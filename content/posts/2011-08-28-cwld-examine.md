Another addition to my very small, but exploding with growth, [collection of words for later disuse](http://ryanfitzer.com/tag/cwld/).

  Examine

      _The artist's most recent paintings examine the deeper relationship between dogs and the game of poker, a game, once thought, only enjoyed by humans._

      I have yet to see any work _examine_ anything. It's just another term used in an attempt to elicit rigor. While works unfortunately described by this term _may_ provoke the viewer to examination, they themselves do no such thing.
