I've been working on a handful of drawings but this sketch represents the opposite end of the spectrum from them. I feel like I'm slowly honing in on what best describes what I'm thinking.

It's easy to feel like I'm on to something when what I'm working on starts to take some sort of recognizable state. But I keep having to ask myself what is it that I recognize. I have to be careful to make sure that it's what I'm seeing in my own head and not some technique I've responded to in someone else's work.

I left the studio Friday with a feeling of exuberance, only to come in Saturday feeling like I was still way off the mark. I was able to turn that around by the end of the night by gaining some clarity through objectively looking at what I had done (which came out very heavy-handedly).
