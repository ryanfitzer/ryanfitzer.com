![The mixing of the material](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/knife-bucket.jpg)

A water saturated ceiling tile, mixed down with a hand-held drink mixer from CVS ($15-$19). Basically, some paper, wood pulp and calcium carbonate.

![Pouring the mold](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/floor-plaster.jpg)

Plaster mold (in a kitty litter box) of an Ikea bowl. I just needed something quick and easy and with no undercuts to test this whole deal.

![Drying the mold](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/mold-fan.jpg)

Drying the mold with a fan. Actually, I already tried to cast the pulp mixture with little success because the mold was to wet (I'm a little impatient). The mold is warming in the oven as I write. More to come.
