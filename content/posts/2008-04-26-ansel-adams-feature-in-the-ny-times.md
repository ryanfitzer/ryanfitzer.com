Nice [Ansel Adams slideshow](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/04/27/travel/20080427_YOSEMITE_FEATURE.html) w/audio in the NY Times. The audio is from Andrea G. Stillman, his former assistant with whom he worked in the 1970's.

On color:

> "As an artist he felt that he could not make a creative statement in color because people would expect the color photograph to exactly mirror nature. Whereas when he was working in black and white he could create, what he called, a departure from reality."
