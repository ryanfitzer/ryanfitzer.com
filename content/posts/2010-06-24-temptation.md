[Temptation- Tom Waits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o72GDj7svq4)

A snowy trip to Buffalo somewhere in the mid 90's, driving a black, VW Fox. I did a 360Â° just before the exit to Robin's place. Hit some 'black ice' and regained control like nothing happened. We watched a preschool production of The Wizard of Oz that was most likely the first play I'd ever seen. It was excellent. Waited in her dad's white S-10 with this tape playing while she got the tickets. The snow was coming down and the passenger-side view of the early to mid-century school building was beautiful.
