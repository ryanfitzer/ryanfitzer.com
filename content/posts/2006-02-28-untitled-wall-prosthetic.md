Untitled | 2006 | ceramic, wood, latex and acrylic paint, nail polish, acoustic texture and joint compound

This work is a continuation of [something](http://ryanfitzer.com/?p=634) I started a year ago. The main difference is that instead of being connected to the wall with lots of joint compound, this piece hangs on the wall.
