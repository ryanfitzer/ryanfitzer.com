[Bangladeshis, Koreans stake out their pieces of L.A.](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lopez8-2009nov08,0,1735092,full.column)

> I couldn't help but notice that the Bangladesh Assn. was above a Oaxaca restaurant and a Salvadoran furniture shop, and next door to a Guatemalan mail service. Also nearby, in the same building, was a Peruvian smoke shop and a Korean American cellphone shop owned by a Korean national who speaks Spanish, but not Bengali.

All this "Little \[Country\]" stuff really becomes tiresome as it does little to actually describe any neighborhood. Not only that, no one ever agrees on the boundaries anyway. When I tell people I live in Koreatown they ask where, when I say "1st and Vermont" they say "That's not Koreatown". When I tell someone else that I live near Koreatown but my neighborhood doesn't have a name, they say "No, you live in Koreatown".
