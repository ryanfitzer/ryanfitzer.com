Elizabeth and I went to see [Carmina Burana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmina_Burana) at the Hollywood Bowl last night (tickets start at $1) and had a really great time. Most people don't know the actual title of the composition but have heard it in many a movie. Here is the most famous part, (recorded during the performance and only performed at the beginning and end):

It was beautiful. The conductor (Bramwell Tovey) performed one his own compositions first ([Urban Runway](http://www.calendarlive.com/music/cl-gd-musiccandy3phil-2008jul03,0,4593327.story?track=rss)) as well as [Don Juan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Strauss)) by Richard Strauss. He was very vocal about his inspirations which at first I found a little more than I wanted to hear (on with the music, right?) but once the music started I found that I was really able, for the first time, to see how inspiration leads to music as opposed to an object. This may seem rudimentary to some but it was a valuable discovery for me. I was able to visualize the music. Big stuff.

Anyway, the Bowl is beautiful. The air is crisp, the sound is sharp and the view is memorable. We are definitely going back.
