Diorama Detail | Museum of Natural History | Los Angeles

Went to the Museum of Natural History in Los Angeles a while back and spent 3.5 hours taking pictures. They had to kick me out as I was still shooting after everyone left. What stuck with me most were the fish dioramas. Beautiful forms on colored backgrounds, lit from above to create a gradation similar to water.

It was inspiring to see and it definitely has a relationship to my work. If nothing else, it affirms my own vision of how I see my work progressing. There have been times when seeing something had the opposite affect.

### Studio Space

I've come to the conclusion that my dinky dining room isn't going to cut it for a studio space (didn't take me very long) so I've started looking near downtown LA. What I need is 500-600 ft2, cement floors, lots of wall space, high ceilings (at least 9 ft) and plumbing. If you have any leads [contact](http://ryanfitzer.com/?page_id=6) me.
