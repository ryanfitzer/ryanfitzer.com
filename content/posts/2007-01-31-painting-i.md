_Untitled_ (Detail) | 2007 | Oil and Graphite on Canvas

Finally making time to work in the studio. It feels great. At first I felt so disconnected, but it was short lived and soon all the projects I've put on hold for so long came rushing back with clear focus.

Above is the start of a series of paintings inspired by the [window paintings](http://ryanfitzer.com/?p=133) I've written about in the past. Still new to painting and so far I'm energized by the process. The ability to "sculpt" a surface with paint is very similar in execution to my past work with clay.
