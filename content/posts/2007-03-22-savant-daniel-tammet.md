An incredible [video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3372301236664593143) about savant Daniel Tammet's ability to associate numbers with shape, color, texture, movement and emotion. He can recite Pi to the 22,000+ decimal point in 5 hours. His ability to take facts, processing them emotionally and and return facts is definitely worth watching.
