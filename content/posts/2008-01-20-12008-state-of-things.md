I'm working through some "aggressive" deadlines (that's what they call 'em at work, kinda lame) culminating next Friday. Visited some studio space last week. It consisted of a series of basement servants quarters from the early 1900's. Couldn't have been more than 100 square feet, a sink and a water heater. Not much of an existence. The landlord said that they were probably Puerto Rican immigrants who felt lucky to have a space to themselves and to be pursuing the "American Dream". The rooms were just filled with junk, as if their function was always storage, regardless of what they contained. Really erie. Needless to say, it didn't work out.

I'm really getting desperate for space. Elizabeth put up a Craigslist [posting](http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/hou/546081236.html) for me tonight. Hope something comes through.
