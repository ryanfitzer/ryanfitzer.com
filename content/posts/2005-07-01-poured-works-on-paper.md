'doth protest too much' | 2005 | 40x30 inches | wine on paper

These drawings are the result of trying to escape the drawback of gravity that was inherent in the sculptural work I had been making. I also wanted to use as drawing materials, mediums that could be seen as addictive or overindulgent. Trying to replicate the characteristics I was looking for in acrylics and other normal drawing/painting materials wasn't working. I finally had the idea to just use the materials themselves. Among the edible things I tried, wine and coffee worked the best.

The wine creates a nice effect as the sugar recrystallizes providing a sparkling effect. The darker areas are where the wine pooled. With the coffee, I created a richer shading effect by brewing finely ground coffee in a French press. The grounds congregated in the areas where the paper buckled and I used spray-fix to keep them put.

Three of these were exhibited at the MAC in Dallas, Texas in an exhibition entitled "[Conspicuous Production](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/?p=30)".
