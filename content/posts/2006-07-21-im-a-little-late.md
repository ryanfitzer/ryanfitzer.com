A friend referred me to an artist who is working in a similar vein. Sometimes this can really suck and other times it's just what one needs to work through an obstacle. I'm not sure which occasion this one fits into at this point. The artist is [Jill Downen](http://jilldownen.com/launch.html) and you can watch an [interview](http://ia310117.us.archive.org/1/items/Jill_Downen_at_Bruno_David/downendavid.mov) with her at [Bruno David Gallery](http://www.brunodavidgallery.com/).
