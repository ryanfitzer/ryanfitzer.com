[The most beautiful suicide (kottke.org)](http://www.kottke.org/08/07/the-most-beautiful-suicide)

Every time I've seen this picture it has truly depressed me. Not because it's an attractive woman, but because she looks like she's sleeping. Like there is still a chance. I want to believe that this isn't true.

I'm an so desensitized to gory pictures and movies that this just sneaks up on me.
