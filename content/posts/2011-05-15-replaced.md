Yes, I have now replaced both of my manual cameras. This was a shitty first-half of a year in regards to my cameras. First, I forced the winder on my Hasselblad and [broke the mirror arm](http://ryanfitzer.com/2011/01/an-ode-to-my-hasselblad/). Then, a few weeks ago, my Nikon F3 fell off the dining room table and the winder mechanism refused to advance. I also fell with it in my padded shoulder bag while skating across a street. Seriously, what's with the winders?!

I understand the Hasselblad, but the Nikon is a tank. I originally bought it from friend and skateboard photographer [Nick Accurso](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fatnick/) in the late 1990's. That thing took a beating with him. But with me, if it falls off a table onto a wooden floor/onto a street in a padded bag and it's done? The advance gear is probably just jammed, but the cost to fix it was the same as the used replacement, and the replacement is in waaay better condition.

So, here they are, in a really corny shot on my dining room table.

Original Nikon is from 1982, the "new" one, 1984. Original Hasselblad, 1960, the "new" one, 1991.

Also, this was my first time successfully haggling on the price. I usually just accept what they're asking, I hate talking money.

I still India posts in the queue. Yeah, it's been that way for a loooong time, I know. But, good things take time.

Some useful manuals: [Nikon F3](http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/nikonf3ver2/index.htm) and [Hasselblad 503cx](http://www.cameramanuals.org/prof_pdf/hasselblad_503cx.pdf).
