The first coat of white to see the inconsistencies

It's moving along. The inconsistency of the first coat of white is actually pretty nice. Normally I would make sure the surface is fully opaque and consistent, but the variable quality of the color gives a bit more depth.

But then again, as I'm writing this, I realize it could also have the unwanted relation to the Joker's makeup in Batman.

Well, shit.

I hate when that happens. I really wish I hadn't of thought of that. I suppose it's a good thing. I don't want my work to be taken as fan art.

Anyway, We'll see where it goes.
