[![{mold work} Waiting for the urethane to dry](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/mold_work_18.jpg)](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/mold_work_18.jpg)[![{mold work} Cast released from top half of mold](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/mold_work_27.jpg)](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/mold_work_27.jpg)

The casts are coming along nicely. So far I have had two successes. The third attempt never cured (poor mixing job). The image on the left shows the top of the mold. The aluminum foil is to keep the urethane (amber material) from sticking to the wood. On the right shows the cast after I took the wood top off. The pink is the silicone rubber face of the mold. The amber and pink look pretty beautiful/disgusting together. The next step will be to take the two casts and combine them into one (mirror image) and then make a mold of that.
