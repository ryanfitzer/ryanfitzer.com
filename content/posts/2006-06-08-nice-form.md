![Screenshot of Corpse Bride character](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/corpsebride.jpg)I snapped this the other day while watching Tim Burton's "_Corpse Bride_". Not that great of a movie but the some of the characters were beautiful. The special feature section where they show how the characters are made is worth the watch. It was probably the most engaging part of the film. This form might end up somewhere, or not.
