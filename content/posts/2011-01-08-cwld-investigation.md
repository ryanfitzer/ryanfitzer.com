I am starting a [collection of words for later disuse](http://ryanfitzer.com/tag/cwld/) in talking and writing about art (CWLD). This is not meant as a passive-aggressive jab at others, but a way to call attention to words I find have simply lost any contextual meaning in writing on art. I also need an outlet to bitch instead of using Elizabeth as my sounding board.

	Investigation

	    Besides sounding clinical and detached, it fails to accept, or add, any context from, or to, the words and ideas in its periphery. While describing a work, or an idea, as "an investigation" is technically valid, it makes the description just that, technical.
