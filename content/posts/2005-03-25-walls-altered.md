![Installation View | Art Show Here | Jeanette Kennedy Gallery](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/ash-install.jpg)

This installation represented the first non-ceramic work I'd ever exhibited. When I started the year-long residency program through the University of Texas at Dallas I was just out of graduate school and making ceramic sculpture. For the first six months of the residency I experimented with lots of different materials outside of clay with little success. With this series I was trying to get past the limitations of my small pedestal work and make something that had an impact on what ever space it was in. I thought of these pieces as a response to the clean, clinical and benign space that normally represents a gallery, hemorrhoidal growths that interrupt an otherwise unblemished wall. I positioned them at heights that would create relationships with one's lower body as these are areas that usually show the most signs of overindulgence.
