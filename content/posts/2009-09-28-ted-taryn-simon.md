Taryn Simon [talks](http://www.ted.com/talks/taryn_simon_photographs_secret_sites.html) about her photographs for TED. She's a bit rigid (TED is a big deal) but her explanation of her work shows she has real meaning behind what she does. It is devoid of the contrived/constructed bullshit that much contemporary art is built upon (or used for justification, after the fact).

[Gallery](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/galleries/hidden_and_unfamiliar/) of some of her photos at The Morning News.
