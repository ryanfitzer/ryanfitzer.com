Wall Prosthetic In Progress

I actually got 8 full hours in my studio last Saturday. It felt like the first stretch after one wakes up, except for 8 hours. I started with the wall prosthetic [I began 2 years ago](http://ryanfitzer.com/gallery/stage-one). It started to come together pretty quickly as I'm more in need of finishing it than over-thinking it.

I also pulled out the fingernail polish and painted some teeth [I casted](http://ryanfitzer.com/gallery/not-going-as-expected) forever ago.

Trying little bits of everything

Did a bunch of other stuff as well. The beginning of ideas that have been milling around for a while. More to come.
