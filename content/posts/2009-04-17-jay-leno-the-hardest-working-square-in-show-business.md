Interesting Jay Leno exit interview. He's a pretty humble, hard-working guy if a little self-effacing. Whenever I read about successful comics I'm always astonished at how hard they worked in pursuing their passion. Very inspiring.

I got arrested for vagrancy on Hollywood Boulevard. The same spot, two nights in a row. I had no place to sleep, so I would walk all night. When they gave me my star on Hollywood Boulevard, I told them to put it on the spot where I got arrested.
