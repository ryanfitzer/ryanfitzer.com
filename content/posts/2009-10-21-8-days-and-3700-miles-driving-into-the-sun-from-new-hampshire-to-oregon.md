[8 days and 3,700 miles driving into the sun from New Hampshire to Oregon](http://www.driveintothesun.com/).

Really great simple sketches. I've been wanting to do more drawing that captures views I find interesting. Maybe a good practice to take up while camping where I make a lot more free time for myself.
