[YouTube - Joe McNally - Empire State Building](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEAKQFddTLI&eurl=http://duncandavidson.com/2008/06/changing-your-point-of-view.html)

Shooting the beacon of the Empire State building. This is death defying stuff and with my fear of heights I was really feeling it in the you-know-what's. The end gives you the actual shots. Amazing.
