It's been a while since I've been to my studio. But I am now on a month-long vacation and I have big plans.

Along with the photo compositing I wrote about earlier, I'll be working on a series of works on paper. Here is one that has been ongoing for a long time now.

And a little process.

I'll also get the rest of the India photos posted as my responsibilities start to unwind.
