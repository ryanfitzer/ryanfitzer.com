Tonight was the first bar I've ever been to that has its own [entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki_Ti) on Wikipedia. I first heard of the Tiki Ti from my newly transplanted friend Matt Causey (we met in PA). It was a nice place. Very small and lived-in. Me and E ordered two gin and tonics (and not the good kind-o-gin) and paid $9 a piece. Of course, they are known for there large pours and we basically received 4 for the price of 2. Not bad. Saves you a trip back to the bar, which is good because if I could explain it in an equation it would be dinky2+popular=fucking-crowded.
