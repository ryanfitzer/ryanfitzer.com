Not all the spots are on the east side but it's a beautiful time lapse video none-the-less. I need to try this with my camera.

[The East Side of Los Angeles on a Sunny Day on Vimeo](http://www.vimeo.com/3537180?pg=embed&sec=3537180) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com?pg=embed&sec=3537180)

After close to 2 years here I can name most of the places in the video. Can't believe it's been 2 years already. I remember back in Texas, reading the LA Times to start acquainting myself with the place I was about to move, feeling a cold sweat come over me on how enormous of a city LA was. It didn't take long for it to feel small, in a good way.
