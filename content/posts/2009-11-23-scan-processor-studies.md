There is something very unnerving and beautiful about this video: [Scan Processor Studies excerpts pt.1](http://vimeo.com/7517418) by by [Woody Vasulka & Brian O'Reilly](http://www.vasulka.org/).

> The source materials were generated by Woody using a Rutt-Etra Scan Processor in the 1970s and sat on a shelf for years, having been recently digitized. Woody came into my studio one day and asked me if I would be interested in using them to work on a collaboration, and the project began from there...
