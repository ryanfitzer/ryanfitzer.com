Spent 2-3 hours on Saturday shooting [tar lines on streets](http://ryanfitzer.com/?p=334) only to find out that the film in my camera wasn't advancing. I haven't used a film camera in close to 6 or 7 years and really believed that the film was loaded correctly. I only advanced it one and it looked as if it had caught. Saying it was a real downer was an understatement for sure. I still haven't found that role of film after I threw it across my house. It will probably surface as a cat toy soon enough.
