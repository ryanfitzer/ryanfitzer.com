One of the best pieces of info on CSS I've gotten lately are the great tutorials on Macromedia's website. They are based on Dreamweaver's interface but can be used without (which the author recommends), or with a different web design application. They take a while but you get a lot of info.

Also, there are some great flash files out there to easily manage images and create subtle sideshows. None of them require Flash knowledge or even the application itself (although having flash enables you to change a few settings like dimensions). Even better, they have good FAQ sections to help you set them up.

Here is a good random PHP file that will read the content of any image folder where the file resides and place a random image on your site whenever the page is reloaded. This what generates the random background images on my site. All you do is point to the file instead of an image and your good to go.

[rotator.php](http://automaticlabs.com/products/rotator) (for use on unix servers) | demo is the page your looking at, just refresh. Remember it's random so the same image might come up.
[random_image.aspx](http://www.davelozinski.com/scripts/random_image/index.php?1133898094556) (similar to rotator.php but for use on Windows servers) | [demo link](http://www.mountainviewcollege.edu/gallery)

Here is a very useful site for explanation of specific html tags
