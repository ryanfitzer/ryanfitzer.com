Small Study | 2005 | Acrylic on board

This was made during my time in the UTD/Southside residency and I just came upon it while cleaning up my computer at work. It's a small piece of masonite with thickly poured acrylic and airbrushed with nail polish. I put it up in my studio and eventually photographed it to try out a few ideas in PhotoShop. I'd forgotten about it and really think it makes a lot of sense with the paintings I've been working towards. I'm still trying to put some form to all of the influences I've gathering lately.
