E and I just went to dinner at [Swinger's](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en-us&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=Swingers+los+angeles&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&cid=0,0,15686599197703778893&ei=rcMgSr__CI3utgOsvemZBA&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&resnum=1) and on the way there we saw a replica "Back to the Future" DeLorean. Of course I immediately pulled over and went to check it out. I was able to sit in it as it was on display at theater that was showing the trilogy. Boy, that sucker is small. I could barely get my legs in. But I was so damned excited. For some reason that movie still has a big effect on me.
