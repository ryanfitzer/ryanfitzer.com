Hilarious [Photoshop tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_X5uR7VC4M). My favorite part is when he's scrolling through Bridge to find an image of his marriage certificate. The narrator reminds me of of a love-child between [Dane Cook](http://www.danecook.com/) and David Cross. Found on [BoingBoing](http://www.boingboing.net/).
