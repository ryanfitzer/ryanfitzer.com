We've been getting out a taking in some of the LA entertainment. Last Friday we got tickets to [The Groundlings](http://www.groundlings.com/start.htm). It was soo great! For those of you who don't know anything about them, it is a comedy troop that does sketch comedy and improv. A lot of famous Saturday Night Live performers started there, including Will Farrell, Kristen Wiig and Will Forte. Here is a [sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m72GNRrvc88) from The Groundlings with Kristen Wiig.
