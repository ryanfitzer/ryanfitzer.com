A church group gathered in front of the homeless shelter outside of my studio. There is usually a consistent level of noise coming in from the street, mostly from people calling out to friends or screaming at enemies. The choir was a welcomed reprieve. But, only for a while. They would carry the same tune about Jesus for 10 minutes before changing to another song about, well, guess who... yes, Jesus. The subject matter wasn't really the issue though. It was more that instead of just repeating the whole song, they only repeated the refrain. Over and over again. What's worse is that they had a guy calling out the lyrics a few beats early. I think it was him that got me the most.

But really, it was still nicer than the alternative. I even opened the balcony door and windows so as to hear them better. So enjoy the 30 sec clip below.
