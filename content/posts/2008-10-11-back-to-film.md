I've been researching DSLRs the past couple of months to be as informed as possible before I drop 2k on one. After I decided on the [Nikon D90](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08082702nikond90previewed.asp), my current digital cameras have seemed less than adequate (which of course they aren't).

They have served me quite well in fact. I bought my first one, the [Nikon Coolpix 995](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikoncp995/), in 2001, and I still use it today. I get a lot of laughs though because it's pretty big. One guy was so excited, when he saw me using it he asked "Whoa, is that one of those old pocket TV's?". Granted, it's large, but the split nature of the form has made difficult shots much easier than todays point-and-shoot cameras do with their static LCDs. Most every shot on my [photoblog](http://ryanfitzer.com/category/photographs) was taken with this camera.

Now that I see what I've been missing being unable to take advantage of different lenses, I'm having a hard time using a point-and-shoot camera. During my research I came upon an article at [kenrockwell.com](http://www.kenrockwell.com) about using the photo services of Costco to have his [film developed and scanned](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/free-digital-camera.htm). It still costs money but you get your film back and a CD that allows you to import them onto your computer. For some reason I had it in my head that I was going to have to scan everything manually if I used film. But if asked I would have answered that "of course they scan a CD for you".

So yesterday I took out my old [Nikon F3](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f3.htm) that I've not used, except once, in the past few years and loaded it up with some some old 800 speed film. It was great! Feeling giddy, I shot every mundane thing I could find. The mechanics of manual photography started to come back to me in bits and pieces. One thing I remembered when I finished the roll was that you actually have to set the speed of the film using the camera's ISO dial. Oops! Just shot a roll of 800 using 100 ISO. No big deal. Fixed that on the next roll and actually got [some](http://ryanfitzer.com/photographs/elizabeth-in-the-morning) [good](http://ryanfitzer.com/photographs/bk-belfry) [pictures](http://ryanfitzer.com/photographs/twine-and-bell) out of it.

It ended up costing $25 for two rolls with a CD for each. A little pricey but very worth it if you plan on printing large-scale. I did have to do a little white balancing and Gaussian blurring in Photoshop as I didn't use any filters while shooting and the 800 film was pretty grainy in some of the shots, but hey, I do that anyway.

So long story short, if you still have an old SLR (and a little cash), grab some film and go to town.
