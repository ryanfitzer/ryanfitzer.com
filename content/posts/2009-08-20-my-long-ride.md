I rode my bike to [work](http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=3117319) today. I was really hard and I still have to ride home. 25 miles in total.

Update: I made it home. I could barely walk up the front steps. I had gone back and forth throughout the day on whether I was going to call E and have her pick me up. The ride home was a little easier as the wind was at our backs.

I had been wanting to do this when I first moved to Los Angeles but was too daunted by the distance. I met a recently hired coworker, Giselle, who was making the trip 2-3 times a week. She was nice enough to let me ride with her. She had to stop and wait for me to catch up a couple of times but for the most part I kept pace. I'm definitely doing this more often.

Eventually I might have to get a road bike. The massive tires on my mountain bike provide a lot of drag.
