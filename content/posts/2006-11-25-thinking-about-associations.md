[![Screenshot from a currently untitled video](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/tmarks.jpg)](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/tmarks.jpg)This is a screen shot of a video I started in late summer. It has been simmering for a while as the first attempt was unsuccessful. I've also been using this time to do some refining of the original inspiration. I tend to visualize my way through a concept to minimize any pitfalls that may crop up (sometimes to a fault). I'm finding it an advantage this time because it has allowed me to evolve the idea into something that goes beyond a single statement (at least in my head).

This image has certain associations that I'm not trying to deny, but instead add to or expand upon; bring out something hidden in a way that uses common associations as a foundation to produce a richer experience. Getting past straight documentation is what I find so difficult when it comes to mutual experiences. [Deborah Fisher](http://deborahfisher.blogspot.com/2006/11/representation.html) does a great job of explaining this idea in terms of sculpture.

> I would argue that you've got to have a reason to do something as silly as remake something that already exists... and when it works, it works really well because of this very silliness. Working toward an exact representation of a thing that already exists can result in an act of Platonic Jujitsu.

I'm finding this challenge particularly difficult with video (currently a brown belt), because a faithful representation is needed to tap into the common associations. I'm anticipating that manipulating the timeline will be the solution to moving past these relationships (and no, not a montage!).

I know I'm being somewhat cryptic about the image (can you tell what it is?). It's because I'm not ready to cement what I'm trying to do with it. Although I've worked through a lot, I still feel I need to keep a few wild cards in order to maintain some sense of visual agility that will be stiffened (I know there's a better word) during the editing process.

This will also be the first time sound will be part of my work. Hopefully creating a hypnotizing experience that moves past base relationships. I will probably need help with this aspect as I have little experience working with sound editing. I'm looking forward to this collaboration. I've really started to open up to feedback on my work, something I resisted while in school. Maybe it's because I trust the circumstances of the people I consult (past the confused, insular student stage and into the "real world" version of confusion that I trust more).
