Just got back from NYC attending [CAA](http://www.collegeart.org/). I was out to help a [friend](http://chrisjagers.net) promote his new business, [SlideRoom.com](http://www.slideroom.com). Got to see a few good shows as well as Coney Island. The city had me feeling so claustrophobic that I had to get out for a while. A cold, desolate beach was exactly what I needed. I put some images from the trip on my [photoblog](http://ryanfitzer.com/?cat=8) from the trip.
