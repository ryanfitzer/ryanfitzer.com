Currently reading [Unrepentant Ego: The Self Portraits of Lucas Samaras](http://books.google.com/books?as_list=BDWO8VlwQ4_ja4pX5_6q7ARoU7y9oizKuGIirF8xUDO2io44-NCE).

Donald Kuspit writes: (regarding Samaras's art as a device for rebuilding a damaged ego)

> "Freud said that the ego must assert itself against the oppressive demands of the id, superego, and external reality, and at the same time it must acknowledge and gratify them; otherwise the ego would be torn apart, resulting in the complete loss of self control. To avoid this fate the ego must become creatively non-compliant and must generate the critical creativity necessary for it to master the competition and sustain itself. Creatively enduring their pressures becomes a way of building autonomy and critical consciousness."

Samaras's work exudes a pure energy that I can not help but feed on.
