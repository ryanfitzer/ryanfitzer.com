I'm currently working on making a much more complex version of the earlier animation. I get very frustrated with Flash unlike most applications I use. The interface and tools are so unintuitive. There's always a learning curve when figuring out a new application , but I'm not new to it! I just don't use it very often. Every time I come back to it I have to learn it again.
