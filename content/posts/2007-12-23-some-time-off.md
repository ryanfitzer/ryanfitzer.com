I finally have some time off to relax. I've gotten to a couple of books I recently bought ($9.98 for both!), on [Robert Gober](http://www.matthewmarks.com/index.php?n=1&a=141&im=1) and [Charles Ray](http://www.regenprojects.com/artists/charles-ray/). Both fascinating, both about exhibitions curated/organized Paul Schimmel (chief curator at [MOCA](http://www.moca.org/)).

My relaxation is furthered by the fact that I now own a [brown couch and chair](http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=251414&EXTRA_PARAMETER=ZOOM&PseudoMasterProdID=251414&trackingCat=30247&PseudoCat=30247) (the bare minimum for defining a living-room) to sit/lay in to read these books. Elizabeth and I have spent 4 months in Los Angeles having only our bed or desk chair to sit in. We were starting to go nuts.

Still no progress on a studio space as things have been pretty busy lately. I do a have a lead to follow up on though. We'll see if it pans out. The odds say no but I am always optimistic.

Lastly, E and I spent roughly 4-5 hours walking from gallery to gallery in Culver City only to be let down each time. The exercise was, sadly, the best part of the trip. So far the shows I've seen in LA have left a lot to be desired. I'm sure that will change.
