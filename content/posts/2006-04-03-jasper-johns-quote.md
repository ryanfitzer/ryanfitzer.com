I read a Saltz review of artist Tara Donovan's new piece at [PaceWildenstien](http://www.pacewildenstein.com/Exhibitions/ViewExhibition.aspx?guid=d047796a-b6bb-4b44-93f5-aad021f7b959) in the [Village Voice](http://villagevoice.com/art/0614,saltz,72707,13.html) today that had a great quote from Jasper Johns:

"Take an object."

"Do something to it."

"Do something else to it."

Sounds pretty easy doesn't it?
