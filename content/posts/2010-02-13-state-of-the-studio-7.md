Still sketching. Trying to add more color. No idea will this is leading, if anywhere. I've realized that I don't need to know, as long as I just keep making whatever it is I want to see. This way of thinking has helped me to relax and experiment more.

I've found that I like using very wet media. This line was made with a [small rubber ear syringe](http://health-and-beauty.become.com/3new-bulb-syringe-anal-irrigation-ear-enema--compare-prices--sc881094001) with a inner tube needle inserted in the tip. I've used these a lot in the past, especially while making the [wine and coffee drawings](http://ryanfitzer.com/2005/07/poured-works-on-paper/).

I made new tables! I love these suckers. So much space to spread things out. At some point I'll write a how-to on making one. Pretty simple design and solid as a rock.

Thinking about the color I choose to photograph, I shot this on my way out of the studio the other night. The crack's line quality also drew me in.

The building used to be an old Army Navy store.
