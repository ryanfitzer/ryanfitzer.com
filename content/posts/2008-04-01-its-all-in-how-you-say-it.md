Great Post by Carol Diehl (by way of [Chris Jagers](http://chrisjagers.net/wp/?p=1030)) on texts from the Whitney Biennial: [Impenetrable prose from the Whitney Biennial](http://artvent.blogspot.com/2008/03/random-quotes-from-information-about.html)

My favorite:

> This early work's active impediment of a unified spectatorial vantage point has led the artist to investigate, in his words, "a variegated relationship between painting—a practice whose ossified discursive and speculative value I want to mark with its various economic and technical support systems—and the contradictions of discursive engagements that subsist largely outside the site of display, but which are value-producing sites nonetheless."

Just gorgeous.
