It's a moat, with twine and candle wax and filled with water, acrylic and ink.

I have this great [papasan chair](http://www.papasanfurniture.com/) that I originally got for E to hang out in. I now have it in the middle of the studio and it serves as the nap/look-at-the-wall-and-consider-my-formal-concerns chair.

For some reason the first thing I do when I get to the studio is take a nap. After that, I make a pot of coffee and things get movin'. Today went well.
