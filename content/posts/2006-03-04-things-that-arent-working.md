I 'm starting work on an idea with a medium I've never used before, paint. I disliked painting when I was in art school because of it's (perceived) lack of immediacy. These images represent some of the first studies. Don't worry, I know they're bad. But these only took about 30 minutes a piece and are going to get me somewhere little by little (whether I like the results or not).

I've been thinking a lot about the medium of paint. Working in 2-d is still a little new to me, despite 3 years of drawing (art school). I simply learned drawing as a way to represent the physical from observation. But what I'm working with now has no physicality to observe. This is what I need to invent.
