[Vivian Maier - Her Discovered Work](http://vivianmaier.blogspot.com/)

> I acquired Vivian's negatives while at a furniture and antique auction. From what I know, the auction house acquired her belongings from her storage locker that was sold off due to delinquent payments. I didn't know what 'street photography' was when I purchased them.

The lot included 30-40,000 negatives from the 60's and 70's with 600 rolls still undeveloped. Beautiful photography.

I just bought a Holga to play around with medium format (I get my first roll back on Monday) and now I'm looking at the type of camera Maier used, a Twin Lens Reflex. [B&H; has A Segull for pretty cheap](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/247807-USA/Seagull_P05440_GC_109_Camera.html).
