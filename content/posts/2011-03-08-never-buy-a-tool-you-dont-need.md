I've eventually found a use for twitter.

I like to share links via Google Reader, but it's mostly with just a few people as I'm really sensitive to noise in my feeds (what a statement...). Anyway, I've begun the sharing [@ryanfitzer](http://twitter.com/ryanfitzer).

Actually, I started [@rfitzer](http://twitter.com/rfitzer) last fall with a web development focus. It's been really useful. Some things just don't show up on blogs.

And, as for the separate accounts, as my good friend [Rick](http://richardnickel.wordpress.com/) observed so long ago, "You like to keep things in separate little boxes". More true than ever.

Also, while working a million hours day and night at my day-job and one freelance project, I do have grand plans for an upgrade to this site. The front page already has a finished psd just waiting to be coded.

P.S. @rpfdev compliments my web development focused site, [ryanpatrickfitzer.com](http://ryanpatrickfitzer.com), if you have such leanings.
