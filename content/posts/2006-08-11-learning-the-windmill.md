I used to breakdance in the 80's and never learned the windmill. Lately, for some strange reason, I've been thinking about it a lot. So much so that I had a dream the other night about actually trying to learn. We'll see. If I ever get a large enough space to practice in where no one can see me embarrass myself, I think I might give it a try. If it works out, I will definitely add it to the slew of [YouTube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aN1FSsOd44s) on the subject.
