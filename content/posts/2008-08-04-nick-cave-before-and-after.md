[Before and After #41: Nick Cave](http://tsutpen.blogspot.com/2006/09/before-and-after-41nick-cave.html)

I just finished reading a biography on Nick Cave and this before and after is a great illustration of what he was like in his younger years, rebellious for the sake of rebellion, he lived to piss people off

The second photo reminds me of a neglected bass guitar I saw at Goodwill this weekend. It was dark green, beat up and rotten, with "Eat Shit" carelessly written in black, thin marker with adolescent handwriting skills.
