I've been guilty of some these [artist website no-no's](http://www.linesandcolors.com/2007/05/31/how-not-to-display-your-artwork-on-the-web/) in the past. Who knows, maybe I still am seeing as how you have to slide open a javascript drawer just to read this entry (I'll be changing that soon enough though). Pretty good read.
