A great [article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/oncreativity) by [Andy Rutledge](http://www.andyrutledge.com/) on creativity as a tool and independent from self expression.



> The most effective use of creativity begins with a litany of very un-creative things called "facts"â€”the facts we get to know during the discovery process.

Also, linked by a commenter on the article, Sir Ken Robinson's [talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/66) on creativity for [TED](http://www.ted.com). It's more anecdotal than informative, but still a great talk
