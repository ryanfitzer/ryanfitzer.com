I had a dream last night that I went back in time to the 50's. It was all mostly based on Michael J. Fox's experiences in _Back to the Future_. The main differences were that I was still in LA (and it was just as dirty), my cell phone was transformed into a kids space-age (for the 50's) toy and instead of a skateboard, I had to use a couch pillow (no, it didn't float and I ruined it on my first ride).

The only reason I'm explaining this is because when I opened my feed reader this morning this [picture](http://www.shorpy.com/node/6785?size=_original) from [Shorpy](http://www.shorpy.com) came up. Coincidence?
