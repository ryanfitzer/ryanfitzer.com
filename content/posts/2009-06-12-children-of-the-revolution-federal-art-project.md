C'mon, with art like this, who needs art?

> With Children of The Revolution I started thinking about this idea of education and teaching and "passing the torch." I went to UCLA and studied with Chris Burden, Paul McCarthy, Charlie Ray and Roger Herman. I feel that theyâ€™ve all been very influential on my practice. I always think about that "brotherhood" and the responsibility of sharing the information. Like the SKULL AND BONES Society at Yale, that secret brotherhood that a lot of big time politicians have been a members of, I sort of think about this brotherhood as being akin to that. A secret society where we share and pass on information that manifests itself in our works but that the general public is not really privy too.
