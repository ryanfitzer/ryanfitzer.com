[50 Years of Stupid Grammar Advice - ChronicleReview.com](http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i32/32b01501.htm).

I've only recently heard of Strunk and White but a lot of their lessons sound very familiar. Of course, I rarely paid attention to grammar, and writing in general, when I was in school. Writing a paper was like getting a root canal without anesthesia. Not because it was just a lot of work, I just had such a hard time holding focus on an idea through pages of writing.

Using a computer to compose my writing has made things much easier. Each sentence feels less cemented in its position (in my head, at least). They feel more like building blocks that I can easily rearrange in whatever order needed to build my prose.

After pages and pages of handwriting I would lose my direction and end up scrapping the whole thing. Every wrong turn only compounded the problems with the only solution being starting over from the beginning.

Outlines were just posturing as far as I was concerned. Thinking about now, I would have had a much easier time with all of this if I'd taken a class that was solely dedicated to building outlines.
