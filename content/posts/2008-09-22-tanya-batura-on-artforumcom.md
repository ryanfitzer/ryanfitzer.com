Tanya's work reaffirms my faith in LA galleries showing experienced artists. Great work gets to be a little thin around here. And congratulations to her for all the great coverage.

> Though "Monochroma" is strictly limited to heads and necks, taken as a group, the series conveys a surprisingly fluid motion: The arch of a truncated shoulder and the smooth curve of a cheek morph easily into elegant abstraction. While the subject matter flirts with lulling viewers into an unconscious appreciation of violence, Batura evades this trick and instead carves out a nuanced if queasy place where pathos resides side by side with harmony, historic ideals of beauty are part and parcel with contemporary images of suffering, and the tension between attraction and revulsion remains pragmatically taut.
