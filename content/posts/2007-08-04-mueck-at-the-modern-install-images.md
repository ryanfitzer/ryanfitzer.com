Like the [Brooklyn Museum](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/), the [Fort Worth Modern](http://themodern.org) has [posted installation shots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/10468439@N05/sets/72157601021948061/) to [Flickr](http://flickr.com). I was lucky enough to witness parts of the install as well as chat with Mr. Mueck. The reason being was that I was preparing for a kids workshop that artist Patrick Young (present in a few of the pics) and I were teaching the next week. I will be writing about the workshop and posting some of the kids work from it soon (It's some great stuff).
