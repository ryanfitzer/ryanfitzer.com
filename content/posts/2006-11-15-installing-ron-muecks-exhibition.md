If more museums made their "behind the scenes" as available as the [Brooklyn Museum](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brooklyn_museum/sets/72157594352071092/show/) is doing, I'd bet you'd see a lot more traffic at the shows. They are, in effect, getting the viewer more invested in the exhibition by showing what it takes to do the install. DVD's do the same thing (not usually all that well though) to make them more appealing to own. Of course, not every installation is quite as exciting as [Ron Mueck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Mueck)'s.
