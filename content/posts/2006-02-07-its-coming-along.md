![In progress view](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/inprogress.jpg)

Another in-progress of what I'm working on. Got a lot done this weekend on it. Maybe it's a little corny to only show so much of it but I take these photos for myself as a way of looking at my work differently. It can be really hard at times to block out what's around, especially when your studio is as dinky as mine. It needs another coat of paint and then the airbrushing starts.
