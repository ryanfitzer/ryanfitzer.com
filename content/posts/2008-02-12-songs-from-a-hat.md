_Songs From a Hat_ is a Youtube series I happened upon tonight after a long day of apartment cleaning (well, half a long day). The musician, Abby Simons, solicits song titles from her viewers and writes a new song every Sunday. Most are excellent and have a lot in common with [Kimya Dawson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3LkW70LZY8). My favorites so far are:

[CackerJacks and Cornflakes Don't Taste Good Together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYK2GJXGM_Q&feature=user)
[Winnie the Pooh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLpu1RAdzjg&feature=user)
[Life of a Sidekick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6YHg5DuCUU&feature=user)
[Please Don't Dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HfE7N7hlyE&feature=user)
[Left on the Right Side of the Road](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQDKopc22F8&feature=user).

Her youth and candor make me feel a bit <del>old</del> mature and <del>stuffy</del> reserved :)
