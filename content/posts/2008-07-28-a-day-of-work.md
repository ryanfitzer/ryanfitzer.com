![Gessoed Paper / Airbrush Blotter](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/gesso-sketch.jpg)

Had my first day of working in my studio. I know every artist goes this but it's always humbling and worrisome when the thing in your head turns out to be a turd in the studio. I didn't have quite that experience but using a little hyperbole helps to place it a little more clearly (whatever that means).

I started to experiment with the synthetic tar more, and believe me, it really looked like shit, literally and figuratively. It's not a hugh deal as I realize there is a long way to go when working towards a new vision but things become hard when you get to a point when you feel like you have no idea which way to go. Like you have no sense of what's good vs. what's not.

It's a bit unnerving at times but something I'm sure comes and goes.

The image above shows my doodle/blotter sketch while I was trying some airbrushing on a tar piece. Needless to say, it didn't work out the way I wanted (or else I would have shown it). I ended up gessoing over what I had done. I have some paper ready for next week. We'll see how things go. I have some thoughts.
