![studio-6-2-09](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/studio-6-2-09.jpg)

Not much to say except that I'm taking a slower, more layered approach to these drawings. Trying to build up the image over a longer period of time. I also painted over the last one. I have a clearer idea (although, it's still pretty fuzzy) for them.

I'm trying to post more. I don't always have much to write (or show), so I think I'm going to borrow a theme from [Dennis Hollingsworth](http://www.dennishollingsworth.us/) and simply post state-of-the-studio images here and there. He pieces his together [way cooler](http://www.dennishollingsworth.us/archives/002085.html) though.
