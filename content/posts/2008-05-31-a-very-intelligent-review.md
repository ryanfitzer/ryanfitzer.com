From: [Street Language and Sign Language at Woodward Gallery](http://zine.artcal.net/2008/05/street-language-and-sign-langu.php)

> If the individual pieces are interesting, the show does little more than try to blatantly market aspects of a scene that doesn't really thrive in a petri dish (or a conventional art gallery). This exhibition highlights the continuing problem street art faces as it responds to growing popularity and its practitioners try to cash in on their burgeoning fame. The show does little to address the urban lexicon and actually some of its volatile energy.

I've always found it hard to articulate my thoughts on overly graphic street art in the context of a gallery setting. Hrag Vartanian from [ArtCal's Zine](http://zine.artcal.net) reviewing two shows in NYC does a really smart job of it.

He echos my feelings on the setting being more the problem than the work itself, while still acknowledging its strengths. I always find myself repeating the Seinfeld mantra "not that there's anything wrong with that" when trying the explain that while I have no particular bias towards this type work (in fact, i find inspiration at times), seeing it in a gallery setting leads me to engage with it differently (and the work just never holds up) than I would in public or a design setting.
