[Zapruder Film Stabilized](http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/0512/zapruder_-_stable.mov)

Not only can you the see the events more clearly, you can start to make out emotions as well. Just horrible.

And come on, you'd have to be crazy to think that the shots actually came from the book repository. The location of the shot and the direction JFK's head reacts to the shot clearly makes the origin of the shot perpendicular to the side of the car.

I know, it's old news
