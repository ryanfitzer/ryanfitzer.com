I started covering the handle in salt a [while ago](http://ryanfitzer.com/2009/06/state-of-the-studio/). I finally decided it was done and hung it above my studio door. Hopefully it'll give some good luck.

Quick sketches of [street tar contours](http://ryanfitzer.com/2007/05/street-tar-contours/) with ink and colored pencil on velum.

Patterns based on traffic signal embeds. The actual patterns are great but my sketches are a long way off. Acrylic and oil on paper.

Just a quick post to keep things alive around here. I've been getting to the studio a lot more lately. Things have been going smoothly. Not much else to say.
