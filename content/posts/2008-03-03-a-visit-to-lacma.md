E and I visited the [Los Angeles County Museum of Art](http://www.lacma.org/) this past weekend and I shot a few pictures of pieces that had an impact on me. Of course, the collection was so large that I had no time to record the credits/captions of each piece, much less spend time with everything that piqued my interest.

We also saw the new [Broad Contemporary Art Museum](http://www.lacma.org/art/ExhibBCAM.aspx). It's a great show but I left with much to be desired. I take that back, the [Cindy Sherman](http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=cindy+sherman&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1) collection was excellent. Her photographs are so rich. I could spend a day just looking at them.
