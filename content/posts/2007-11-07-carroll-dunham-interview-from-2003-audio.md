While searching for images of [Carroll Dunham](http://www.artnet.com/artist/5542/carroll-dunham.html)'s work to show a friend I came across this [four part interview](http://dir.salon.com/story/audio/bomb/2003/02/14/dunham/index.html) for [BOMB Magazine](http://www.bombsite.com) on the event of his [retrospective](http://www.newmuseum.org/more_exh_c_dunham.php) at the [New Museum of Contemporary Art](http://www.newmuseum.org/) in New York in 2003. I actually got to see this show during a trip to NY (my inaugural visit) for a grad class. This was the first time I had ever seen Dunham's work and, needless to say, I was blown away. [Part 1](http://media.salon.com/mp3s/bomb_dunham1_020703.mp3), [Part 2](http://media.salon.com/mp3s/bomb_dunham2_020703.mp3), [Part 3](http://media.salon.com/mp3s/bomb_dunham3_020703.mp3), [Part 4](http://media.salon.com/mp3s/bomb_dunham4_020703.mp3). I'm still warming up to his [recent work](http://gladstonegallery.com/dunham.asp). But, of course, I have yet to see it in person.
