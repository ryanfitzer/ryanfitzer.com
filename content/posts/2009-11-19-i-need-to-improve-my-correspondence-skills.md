This [ correspondence between a Blockbuster customer and manager](http://www.27bslash6.com/blockbuster.html) about late movies put tears in my eyes:

> With the possible exception of Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, the movies were not worth watching let alone stealing. In Logan's Run, for example, the computer crashed at the end when presented with conflicting facts and blew up destroying the entire city. When my computer crashes I carry on a little bit and have a cigarette while it is rebooting.
