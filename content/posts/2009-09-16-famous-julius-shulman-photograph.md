Every time I show this [famous photo](http://www.photography-collection.com/uploaded_images/shulman_web-759706.jpg) by Julius Shulman I always expect the response "Oh yeeeeeeah, I've seen that a million times". I have yet to get that response out here in LA (where the house is located).

Besides its prevalence during my art schooling, my mother had a few art books around the house that always employed this photo to represent modernism in architecture. It just became hard-wired into my brain and I thought the same for others.

This came to mind while explaining to a friend how E and I went on a hunt to find the house. Unfortunately, it is on a private drive in the Hollywood hills. After confronting the gate and going back and forth on the decision to jump the fence (in which my better judgment won out...), we drove around to see if we could get any sort of view. We did. It was the bottom of the corner of the house that hangs over the hill (the focus of the photo). There is a little cul-de-sac just below it where I was psyched (pitifully enough) that I was able to see even that much. While E sat in the truck and indulged me, I stood at the bottom of the hill and stared up at the little chunk of history.

They offer tours now but the idea just doesn't strike me as exciting as just walking into the backyard at night (albeit, trespassing).
