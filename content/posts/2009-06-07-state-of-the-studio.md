![Work Table](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/work-table.jpg)

Layering an old saw handle with salt.

I'm dipping and coating things. Salt builds up a nice surface. On the right are a few small samples using different glues, epoxy, spray adhesive and Elmer's. The Elmer's won out. It stays white. I want the coats to eventually change the form to where it's unrecognizable. I've also thought about layering color into the coats.

I went to‚ [Amoeba‚ Records](http://www.amoeba.com/) for the first time on Friday. Huge place. Whenever I go to a new record store for the first time I get insecure because I don't know where to find anything. I feel like a little kid during his first day at a new school.

The place is great. They have everything. Tons of used CD's as well. I picked up a bunch of [Frank Black](http://blackfrancis.net/) and two [performance CD](http://mirandajuly.com/store#store-item-82)s by Miranda July. I'm not sure when I'll feel comfortable downloading music instead of buying on CD. Still doesn't feel right.
