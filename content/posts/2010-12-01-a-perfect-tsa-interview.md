If only this interview could have actually happened.

[Q&A; with TSA Chairman John Pistole](http://blog.wilshipley.com/2010/11/q-with-tsa-chairman-john-pistole.html)

> Which brings me to this question: If you hired a security guard to watch your house, and 10 years later your neighbors said, “Hey, several times now dudes have tried to steal your shit, but we came over and stopped them each time after your security guy let them through,” would you continue to employ him? Especially if every time you tried to enter your house, he grabbed your nuts and took naked pictures of your wife?
