View of LA at night from the roof on my studio

Not much studio progress to speak of. I have a few things in-progress that are about halfway finished though.

[CAA](http://conference.collegeart.org/2009/) is coming to LA in February and I'm looking to get enough work done so I can have a little shindig at the studio where people can see some of the things I've been up to. Got a lot of work ahead of me. Nothing worse than going to an artist's empty studio.
