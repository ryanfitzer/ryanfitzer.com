![Drawing on Wireframe Document](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/wireframe-drawing.jpg)

This is the most creative thing I've done in the past 2 weeks. It is an illustration drawn for a coworker of a massage technique that bruised the shit out of my [ neck](http://ryanfitzer.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/bruised-neck.jpg). My poor cat is having a really hard time since her surgery and I've been taking care of her full-time.
