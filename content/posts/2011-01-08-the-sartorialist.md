Just watched a [nice short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5NgG5koPZU) on [The Sartorialist](http://thesartorialist.blogspot.com/). I love watching the ways street photographers approach people. From what I've seen, there's no common strategy. You just need to be comfortable with what you're doing and ask. They either say yes or no. I'm picking up a roll from the lab where I did my first batch of people shots. Only one person said no, and it wasn't weird.

Now for scanning, which I am way behind on (and India is still in the queue).
