This 60 minute [BBC documentary about British painter Francis Bacon](http://www.ubu.com/film/bacon.html) has some revealing moments of Bacon in his studio (about 15 min in) and a great section in a restaurant where he just gets drunker and drunker. At first I was surprised, then entertained and finally, a little saddened at the reality of it all.

While in his studio, paintings are highlighted with images of source materials. At times it felt like an obvious act, but I was a little surprised to hear how he really feels about his own work (and that of his contemporaries). I wonder when he first made these types of statements publicly? Did he always feel this way or was it once his work gained wide acclaim?
