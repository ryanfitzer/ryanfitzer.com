After my first semester in grad school I wanted to start exploring ideas that dealt with issues I felt more strongly about as opposed to the concept of functional vessels that I had been working with during my time as an undergraduate. During a trip to New York I was able to see the work of Carol Dunham, as well as the rich graffiti that covered certain parts of the city. For me, these images, along with the ideas that were being conveyed, clicked with what I had been thinking about and drawing in my sketchbook. Once I was back I started working on forms that related to intestine-like organs with surfaces that displayed ideas of decadence and sensationalism. I wanted to anthropomorphize the internal forms that mitigated one's external desires.
