[Beautiful remix](http://www.vimeo.com/1109226) (I've not heard the original) of Raidiohead's "Nude" by James Houston using:


  * Sinclair ZX Spectrum - Guitars (rhythm & lead)


  * Epson LX-81 Dot Matrix Printer - Drums


  * HP Scanjet 3c - Bass Guitar


  * Hard Drive array - Act as a collection of bad speakers - Vocals & FX

The video is definitely on par.
