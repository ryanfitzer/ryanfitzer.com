Captain Toe | 2005 | 17x13x8.5 inches | ceramic and enamel

This work is an extension of my work in graduate school. Once I started to put these guys on the floor their concept really started to come to life . They became like little pets to me. Extensions of oneself that represent all of the little things that can take over one's life, plopped on the floor and domesticated. And for the most part, that's how I named them. Little nicknames that just seemed to fit. Like when you get a new pet and you take a while to get a sense of their personality and then use that as inspiration for a name. Sometimes its obvious like Blue, and other times , not so obvious like Captain Toe.
