I have to admit, I'm a little fixated on these 2 videos (nsfw):

[Die Antwoord - Zef Side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77YBmtd2Rw)

[Die Antwoord - Enter The Ninja](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc3f4xU_FfQ)

Her voice, sexuality and haircut are totally at odds and make for a somewhat scary tension (especially in the second video). His low brow rap name (Ninja), Pink Floyd shorts and homemade tattoos belie the controlled, high production values of the video.

No idea what's up with the DJ. In the first video he's seems as if he's slow and has no idea what the hell's going on. In the second, he's portrayed by "progeria sufferer Leon Botha, a prominent Cape Town artist" (which [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Antwoord#Background) told me).

Anyway, fixated.

They're somewhere between performance and spectacle. They've manufactured a very seamless persona and created other, totally opposite personas as well, like [MaxNormal.tv](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRy6pBpwVbk). This [interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeXiZ1HCONQ) shows a bit more of the difference.

I first heard of them via BoingBoing. Give 'em a watch.
