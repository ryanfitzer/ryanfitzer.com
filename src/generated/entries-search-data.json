They are based on Dreamweaver's interface but can be used without (which the author recommends), or with a different webdesign application. They take a while but you get alot of info.\n\n[Macromedia's main CSS site](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/css.html) [Part 1](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css_concepts_mx2004.html) [Part 2](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css_concepts_pt2_mx2004.html) [Part 3](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css_concepts_pt3_mx2004.html) [Part 4](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css_concepts_pt4_mx2004.html) [Part 5](http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/articles/css_concepts_pt5_mx2004.html)\n\nAlso, there are some great flash files out there to easily manage images and create subtle sideshows. None of them require Flash knowledge or even the application itself (although having flash enables you to change a few settings like dimensions). Even better, they have good FAQ sections to help you set them up.\n\n[SimpleViewer](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/) | [demo link](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/photos/) [PostcardViewer](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/postcardviewer/) | [demo link](http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/postcardviewer/example/) [SlideShow](http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001629.shtml) | [demo link](http://whatdoiknow.org/other/slideshow/slideshow.html)\n\nHere is a good random PHP file that will read the content of any image folder where the file resides and place a random image on your site whenever the page is reloaded. This what generates the random background images on my site. All you do is point to the file instead of an image and your good to go.\n\n[rotator.php](http://automaticlabs.com/products/rotator) (for use on unix servers) | demo is the page your looking at, just refresh. Remember it's random so the same image might come up. [random\\_image.aspx](http://www.davelozinski.com/scripts/random_image/index.php?1133898094556) (similar to rotator.php but for use on Windows servers) | [demo link](http://www.mountainviewcollege.edu/gallery)\n\nHere is a very useful site for explanation of specific html tags\n\n[http://htmlhelp.com](http://htmlhelp.com)\n\nAnd last but not least, if your looking for cheap webhosting I use [1and1.com](http://1and1.com). There customer service is 24/7 and there super nice. Don't forget to tell them I sent ya.\n\nNote: I do not provide support for any of these links. Please do not email questions regarding any of the links I've provided. There is usually enough info on each site to get you going.\n"

    "body": "\n![Rooftop squiggle image](images/roof-squiggle.jpg) This image is of a rooftop surface in Queens, NY I shot 2 or 3 years back. I take a lot of photos which act as a sketchbook entry. In my case, images usually do a better job of bringing back whatever it is I was thinking about at the time much better than words.\n\nI took this image to remind me of something I wanted to make in the future. What troubles me is that I'm not sure if I could add anything to this. The image was just meant to illustrate and inspire a new work based on the ideas I've been working with for the past few years. But I have yet to make it. Every time I think I'm ready, I lose faith in what I could add to this image that I didn't already experience. To me, it's beautiful. Not necessarily as a photograph, but in it's actual physical existence. Of course no one else was there so I can only offer you my description.\n\nI think the line is self explanatory. The material used to layer this roof was a gray rubber. When walking on it I felt like I was not walking on a hard, inanimate structure, but something softer and more forgiving. Something between a gym mat and an entryway area rug, the type you could expect to find in the entryway of your average business. I guess what I am trying not to say is that it felt like skin. There was a feeling of wrongness while walking on it. Maybe it was because I was up on the roof illegally (I was later kicked off), I'm not sure.\n\nIn any case, I still think about what I keep this image around for. I've already researched where I could get the materials, so lack of resources isn't stopping me. Maybe it's just a simple lack of understanding.\n"

I saw the studio of an artist in one of those architectural mags like Dwell or something and noticed their easel. It was very simple. A piece of plywood, a ledge (what the painting rests on), and four spring loaded hand clamps (the orange kind).\n\n![Easel detail](images/easel-detail.jpg)I've had two hollow-core doors laying around for a while that I used as level-able surfaces to do my wine/coffee drawings. They weren't doing anything but acting as a headboard for my bed (storage), so I decided to use one of them as an easel. The total cost is around $40. Door: $20 (luan works the best because of it's smooth surface), 2 pieces of white pine measuring 1\"x8\"x6': $11, and two small clamps: around $10 (I tried the hand clamps but they weren't strong enough for what I needed). The glue and screws I already had. I'm sure you could find some shelf type of deal that would work but I needed something heavy-duty because my stretchers are covered with masonite instead of canvas. It took about a half an hour to make. Plus it has clean lines, which I like so much because I'm a design freak.\n"

We were given these gallery spaces at the front of the apt. to use either as a studio or clean space to show our work. The idea with this piece was to fill a small space with very large blob-like forms coming out of the walls. For the most part it was site specific. This way of working is starting to make more sense to me again. I've been thinking a lot about how I want to realize certain works in actual spaces (other than a gallery).\n\nBelow is a small version I did in the apt. during the residency. Everyone who saw it likened it to a boob so it became a wall boob. Of course that was the last thing on my mind. It was a form I was able to create quickly so as to test out if the mold making material (tin cure rubber I think) would set on wet clay. What really stuck for me about this study was how it was located next to the normal, mundane items that one usually finds in a home. Did one activate the other, or did the wall boob become just as ordinary as the light switch and the thermostat? Or something else all together?\n\n![Study | urethane foam, wall paint, acoustic texture | 2005](images/wallblobstudy.jpg)\n\n_Study_ | urethane foam, wall paint, acoustic texture | 2005\n"

Of course, this is the main goal of such signage, but more and more, as I pass by day by day, I start to really wonder why. Is it just the color? Maybe the big, chunky forms used in the lettering? It's probably a mixture of that and more, including the fact that all of these are from the windows of food establishments (I'm weak). But why day-glow? Is that appetizing? Or does it simply get your attention and then hand you off to the next level of advertising? I'm not sure but what I'm interested in is the combinations of form and color represented in these windows, as well as using a recognizable visual language to put forth my own agenda.\n\nThe idea is to paint (something I've not done very well with in the past). There's a culmination of a lot of previous fits and starts brewing in my head and I've had a deep urge to do some flat work to try and accomplish things that wouldn't work in the current sculpture. As they are now, I find these images beautiful enough to very well be the finished works. But I have more needs than just beauty, although that is a big factor. Paintings have an ability to create their own context as opposed to sculpture, which relies, for the most part, on the physical space it resides in. It's context which I find most attractive. One that I can have more control over.\n\nI guess this could be considered a progression of the [poured works on paper](/portfolio/2005-07-02-poured-works-on-paper), the difference being that I saw those as two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects. Objects that float in space, devoid of any context (I wanted a pure focus on the object with no interference). [Orange to Red](/portfolio/2006-03-28-orange-to-red) has a lot more to do with this direction.\n"

[Deborah Fisher](http://deborahfisher.blogspot.com/2006/11/representation.html \"Artist Deborah Fisher's site\") does a great job of explaining this idea in terms of sculpture.\n\n> I would argue that you've got to have a reason to do something as silly as remake something that already exists... and when it works, it works really well because of this very silliness. Working toward an exact representation of a thing that already exists can result in an act of Platonic Jujitsu.\n\nI'm finding this challenge particularly difficult with video (currently a brown belt), because a faithful representation is needed to tap into the common associations. I'm anticipating that manipulating the timeline will be the solution to moving past these relationships (and no, not a montage!).\n\nI know I'm being somewhat cryptic about the image (can you tell what it is?). It's because I'm not ready to cement what I'm trying to do with it. Although I've worked through a lot, I still feel I need to keep a few wild cards in order to maintain some sense of visual agility that will be stiffened (I know there's a better word) during the editing process.\n\nThis will also be the first time sound will be part of my work. Hopefully creating a hypnotizing experience that moves past base relationships. I will probably need help with this aspect as I have little experience working with sound editing. I'm looking forward to this collaboration. I've really started to open up to feedback on my work, something I resisted while in school. Maybe it's because I trust the circumstances of the people I consult (past the confused, insular student stage and into the \"real world\" version of confusion that I trust more).\n"

Worth Modern](http://themodern.org \"The Modern's Main Site\") last Sunday. I had an excellent time and the students seemed to put up with my assignments.\n\nOnce I was back in my own studio I wanted to keep working on a couple of the drawings. The first drawing (above) is from [_Stephen's Iron Crown_](http://themodern.org/f_html/motherwell3.html#top \"Reproduction from the Modern's site\") by [Robert Motherwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Motherwell 'Wikipedia Entry on Motherwell'). The second is after _[For Carl Andre](http://themodern.org/f_html/benglis.html#top \"Link the The Modern's Collection\")_ by Lynda Benglis.\n\nAfter looking at my reworked sketches for a while and not convincing myself of whatever it is I need to in order to feel successful, I began to see a correlation with the process I used when I started working with clay during undergrad.\n\nWhenever I came against my lack of ability to realize a form, I tried a more aggressive approach. The image of the Altered Vase series is an example of this. After making this series of vases and feeling like they were still lacking in whatever way, I started to puncture and crumple each vase. I look back and see this as a function of frustration.\n\nIn the process of learning a skill, mistakes become a necessary part of the process. In my case, the altered vases exemplified my lack of clarity of idea, from which, I was able to see what needed to be refined. Having something physical to respond to was essential (if sometimes awkward) to working though my hand/mind's-eye coordination. This seems not to have changed much.\n\nBut having made these vases, I can still see them in most of the work I make today, like the drawing above. This leads me to the question that if I had never made this series, or instead, tried to think my way through it, would the drawing have turned out the same?\n"

    "body": "\n![Fronts Mold](images/img_0939.jpg)\n\nI had the idea for this in grad school so I bought a plastic arch from an online dental supply store and sat on it until last year. I finally got around to mailing it off to a friend, [Mathew McConnell](http://www.mathewmcconnell.com), and just got it back this week (boy did he take his sweet time, but it was definitely worth it). The idea has been simmering for 3 years now and, as of recently, I've been pretty anxious to get started.\n\n![An Assortment of Grills](images/dental_grills_007.jpg)\n\nA lot of my work is inspired by things I find both compelling and grotesque. Grillz definitely fall into this category. Since moving to Dallas I've been exposed to this trend more than any other place I've lived (something about the \"[Dirty South](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_south)\"). My interest stems equally from how sensational the designs are and the fact that people wear these on something as sensitive as teeth. I find it one of the most visually aggressive ways to ornament one's self while still remaining relatively acceptable in the mainstream.\n\n![Diamonds, Diamonds, Diamonds!](images/grillzdollars.jpg)\n\nBy themselves they are pretty formless and unattractive. As jewelry, the lack of precision heavily contrasts with what I normally consider as valuable; most of the examples I've seen have a very heavy handed craftsmanship that sometimes borders on clunky. The \"more is better\" rule is certainly being applied here.\n\nSize is another issue. Some of these are so massive that they impede normal speech and keep the wearer from closing their mouth. I remember asking an employee at Kroger where his set was made and needing him to repeat it multiple times, \"Muh-sheet... Muh-schckeet... Mesquite\".\n\n![A Little More Polished](images/gr05.jpg)\n\nBut on the other hand, there is something so compelling about seeing someone wearing a set. Somewhat like a train wreck, I have trouble looking away (yeah, like _I've_ seen a train wreck before). But that's only a small part of it. I have a sort of anthropological interest that comes close to redeeming the characteristics I described above. Culturally they're exciting, creative, imposing, and ultimately, human.\n"

Not sure how to execute it so I thought I would do a digital sketch to keep it fresh. The tar used to seal up cracks create such beautiful forms. Originally I figured I would try to take bird's-eye photographs as the finished product. I'm still uneasy about photography. I feel that it would just seem like a copy of an original, although I'm still entertaining the idea. Cutting out a huge piece of asphalt would be great but a little impractical at the moment. Trying to recreate this is still what I'm aiming for.\n\nThe idea popped back into my just yesterday when I thought about going out and painting them where they lie. The complimentary colors have a nice vibration going as well. I'm not very dedicated to the idea so far but I though I could at least give a try without actually defacing public property. I can't imagine what a home owner would think about seeing me out in front painting his/her street (except to call the police).\n"

I have to tend to the mold so often during each cast (3-4 times each hour, per set) that I had to buy a kitchen timer to remind me to execute the next step. I have a few that casted solid as a result of not setting the timer.\n\nI have 17 sets of teeth now and no idea how I'm going to finish them. When the project was in my head it all made sense. Now that I'm actually moving forward on the piece I'm having to rethink everything I originally decided. A lot of what sounded great in my head falls flat when I have real materials sitting in front of me. I'm just going to keep casting until I fill all the Tupperware containers and use the time to formulate my ideas.\n"

So has the amount of time I've have been able to dedicate towards formulating (lots-o-changes around here). My original idea was pretty trite looking back. Very idea centric with no focus on the visual aspect. The two just haven't communicated well. A big pile of teeth can also really conjure up relationships that have nothing to do with my idea and that has been troubling. It just can't be ignored. Understanding this has proven to me that I'm not totally invested in the original concept. At this point, I am a bit embarrassed about it. Not a good starting place for something that takes so much energy to produce.\n\nI'm working to erase my earlier assumptions so as to respond directly to what's in front of me. Ultimately, and to which I reluctantly admit, form comes first for me. I say reluctantly because I'm not entirely comfortable with results that are purely form driven. Form can be the idea, but how those two connect is not something that I feel is easy to execute. So far, I've found it either works or it doesn't. But then again, coming at it strictly from the conceptual side hasn't been bulletproof either.\n"

    "body": "\n![Studio Panorama](images/studioshotsm.jpg)\n\nThe new and somewhat smaller studio | Click image to view larger\n\nBeen wanting to update the site for some time but I been in the midst of a huge move from Dallas to Los Angeles. It was a real bear to find a place within our price range as LA is way more fu@&ing expensive than good ole' Dallas. The new place is 800 sq. ft. and runs $1145 a month compared with 1000 sq. ft. for $725. Luckily it came with a fridge (not so common in LA I hear), but sans central heating and air (unlike the Dallas apt.). The lone heater (pictured behind my tool box above) isn't as much of a problem (Elizabeth feels differently) but the lack of AC was a real problem when the temp was 94° a little while ago (with western exposure!).\n\nSo far, LA has been great. Getting settled has taken some time but we're almost done. I plan on getting to work in my new studio this week. Which brings me to the subject of this post. My studio practice as been highly neglected for some time now (I hate saying how long). My focus has been on learning web development and starting my one man show, [PortfolioRodeo](http://portfoliorodeo.com). I won't go into detail about the business except to say that it's my freelance web development business focusing on websites for artists.\n\nAs we all know, it takes money to be an artist and my (former) day job as a gallery director wasn't cutting it. As a result, I decided to use my studio time to earn extra money making websites. This turned into a real time sucker and I also found that I was using coding as an excuse to not work in my studio as it was much easier to be successful as a web developer than an artist.\n\nSince the move I have gotten to the point where I think I can better balance the two. The business is doing well and I'm a much better developer than I once was. Now the hard part starts.\n\nWhere do I start? Having to pack up one's studio can be pretty eye-opening. Things you've held onto for so long believing they would become useful suddenly become extra weight with the thought of dragging them 1500 miles. The cleansing effect is enormous. I was immediately able to valuate something when space and labor were at a premium as opposed to before when I could just stuff it away somewhere.\n\nThere was a flip side as well. Finished and unfinished works that I had grown indifferent about became instantly invaluable. I dug up a lot of things that I had started but never finished for lack of head space. This is where I'll be starting. I'm not necessarily jazzed about all the unfinished work but I have to start somewhere and this is a place as good as any.\n\nI also have older work to post in the [portfolio](/portfolio) section of the site. I just haven't had much time. It's sometimes hard to see the value of past work when my current work is so different. This also, of course, gives me time to get far enough away from previous work to realize the commonalities it has with more recent work (more like a kick in the head than a \"realization\").\n\nSo look forward to that. As always though, I've been actively posting photos to the blog.\n"

What I like about it is that it looks more like an object than a flat shape. Reminds me of the ceramic shell gating used in casting. I usually find this part of the process more beautiful than the finished bronze. Of course, I'm not a big fan of bronze.\n\nI was able to put some time in the studio this week. Started by reworking a painting I started a while ago. The critique that came back was that it needed more paint. So that's what I did, added a lot more paint. Trying not to make any judgments about it yet.\n\nIt's hard getting from idea to realization. Even harder when you lack a clear idea/vision of what finished means. In the past I've felt that having the most crystallized idea was the answer. The result would be exactly what I was looking for, I thought. This has produced formulaic results. What's missing in this formula process is a philosophy regarding the obstacles that happen along the way. I've viewed them as just that, obstacles, rather than creative injections that can provide richer meaning to the final work.\n\nI'm working towards a broader view as to what \"finished\" means. So far, absorbing obstacles into the creative process makes \"finished\" even harder to describe.\n"

I'm more responsive to this now. The color still isn't quite right (I liked it better before, more muted) but the effect is closer. I've cut out an outline as to where the main form will be moving. Looking at the [original source](/blog/2006/11/18/window-paintings 'Window Paintings') reminded me why I liked it so much. The shape was more fragile, awkward and less balanced.\n"

We were starting to go nuts.\n\nStill no progress on a studio space as things have been pretty busy lately. I do a have a lead to follow up on though. We'll see if it pans out. The odds say no but I am always optimistic.\n\nLastly, E and I spent roughly 4-5 hours walking from gallery to gallery in Culver City only to be let down each time. The exercise was, sadly, the best part of the trip. So far the shows I've seen in LA have left a lot to be desired. I'm sure that will change.\n"

I was accepted with the ceramic sculpture that was completed for my graduate thesis. The reason the residency was so important to my development was that it gave me a year-long soft-landing from grad school during a time when a lot of things in my life/work were in flux. I was able to make a lot of work and branched outside of my ceramic roots for the first time.\n\nIt's really difficult to watch myself on video. I have a hard time being natural. In fact, I wouldn't know natural if it hit me with a stick. Still, I was happy that all the crap that came out my mouth still holds up. Quin Mathews (the filmmaker) spent a good deal of time interviewing me and thankfully only used a little bit. I was so drained after the interview.\n\nI have a hard time articulating my thoughts when I'm talking about my own work. Luckily, it's not evident in the clips he decided to use. But I do come off a little forced at times as a result of the way the film was cut, grabbing parts of sentences and pinning them together. I'm sure there was a good amount of \"blah, blah, blah\" he had to trim.\n\nI wanted to preserve this short documentary because you cannot find it anywhere as the whole thing was pretty informal, also, the program was short lived and shut down in 2006 (it had only run for 2 years). Hopefully Google Video is the right choice and the other residents from the program will find their way to it.\n"

It consisted of a series of basement servants quarters from the early 1900's. Couldn't have been more than 100 square feet, a sink and a water heater. Not much of an existence. The landlord said that they were probably Puerto Rican immigrants who felt lucky to have a space to themselves and to be pursuing the \"American Dream\". The rooms were just filled with junk, as if their function was always storage, regardless of what they contained. Really erie. Needless to say, it didn't work out.\n\nI'm really getting desperate for space. Elizabeth put up a Craigslist [posting](http://losangeles.craigslist.org/lac/hou/546081236.html) for me tonight.

It's 212 ft2 of bliss (50 more than my [dining room](/blog/2007/09/14/a-quick-update)!). It's also only a five minute bike ride from my house.\n\nTook me and E a few days to get the old studio packed up and moved in. The hardest part was/is figuring out the most logical way to cram a bunch of sh\\*t into a small space and still have easy access to what I need without having to move everything around each time.\n\nI've just started to work and I'm already working through long standing problems that have been difficult to think through without a space to do it in.\n\nAs my close friends know, it's not been easy to find a studio space here in Los Angeles. I visited around 4 spaces and read through hundreds of ads in [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites.html)'s [commercial space section with a simple \"art\" keyword](http://losangeles.craigslist.org/search/off?query=art&minAsk=min&maxAsk=max&minSqft=min&maxSqft=max). The spaces were either too expensive (I'm paying $495, still way too much but it's within my budget) or not fit to work in (lack of ventilation and no water source). One space I found was great except I had to become a member of an art collective to get the space. Not sure what an art collective is supposed to accomplish but what I basically took away was that it was about people living an \"artist/creative\" lifestyle. It felt more like the set of \"The Real World\" without all the funding. Not what I was looking for.\n\nWhile the space is small it will do for now. I hope to grow out of it as soon as possible! As well as update this site with my process.\n"

This exhibition highlights the continuing problem street art faces as it responds to growing popularity and its practitioners try to cash in on their burgeoning fame. The show does little to address the urban lexicon and actually some of its volatile energy.\n\nI've always found it hard to articulate my thoughts on overly graphic street art in the context of a gallery setting. Hrag Vartanian from [ArtCal's Zine](http://zine.artcal.net) reviewing two shows in NYC does a really smart job of it.\n\nHe echos my feelings on the setting being more the problem than the work itself, while still acknowledging its strengths. I always find myself repeating the Seinfeld mantra \"not that there's anything wrong with that\" when trying the explain that while I have no particular bias towards this type work (in fact, i find inspiration at times), seeing it in a gallery setting leads me to engage with it differently (and the work just never holds up) than I would in public or a design setting.\n"

    "body": "\n![View Looking South](images/studio-south-small.jpg)\n\nMoved into a new studio this weekend with a guy named [Brant Lavalla](http://brantlavalla.com/) that I met via craigslist.org. I'm really excited and exhausted (long work week as well). The guy in the picture is the building manager, Mark. He's standing on the side I chose, divided by the 2 pillars in the center.\n\nThe place looks pretty clean but lemmie tell ya, it's way dirty inside, pigeon feathers and just general city dust. Spent some time today setting things up. Bought a shop vac and started vacuuming all the corners and sills on my side. Brant and I decided to polyurethane the floor so I thought I'd try to mop the floor in preparation. After getting about 50 ft2 mopped my bucket was black, and the hose to refill it is up a flight of stairs. So I called it a day.\n\nWhich leads me to the water issue. We have bathrooms right outside our door but no sink inside. Brant says he can drill through the floor to pick up the line below and our landlords says it's cool. We just have to let the guy below know. Hopefully it won't be an issue. For now, the hose up the stairs on the roof will do. And oh yeah, the roof is huge! With a gorgeous view of the city. I'll get pic of that up here soon.\n\nSo the big reason I can afford this is twofold. A studiomate to share the rent (1870 ft2 @ $1137.50 per month / 2 = 935 ft2 @ $568.75) and the fact that it is on skid row in east downtown LA. I'm used to being in rough areas but this is much worse. What makes it doable is that it's mostly homeless people who pretty much ignore me. The building is bordered on 3 sides by homeless shelters and a police station on the other side. The building also has a drive in loading dock with a garage door so you can load/unload without the fear of someone grabbing your shit. Of course, I still have to park about two blocks away and skate in.\n\nAll in all I'm ecstatic that I finally have enough space to work in at a cost I can maintain. My last space was miniature and if I made more than a peep the couple living upstairs would ask me to quiet down. That won't be a problem here.\n\nI'm working on were to set up walls as well.\n"

It has been slow because of a couple of busy work weeks. Still some work to do before I can start making.\n\nDrilling for water. The building manager says we can drill through the floor to plumb into the water pipe below. I need to price that out and get official written permission first. Brant thinks it should be pretty easy. We also have to let the guy below us know. In the meantime I have been using the hose on the roof to fill a bucket when needed and the floor bathrooms are right outside our doors.\n\n![Top of the staircase to the roof](images/roof-staircase.jpg)The floor is a big issue because the dust really gets down in the unsealed cement floor. Brant and I are going to try and figure out a way to mop the floor without actually using a mop and bucket (since it really doesn't work). I've looked into an [autoscrubber](http://www.vacuumcleaners.net/vacuum_cleaners/categories/auto_scrubbers_com.html) and that might work if it's not to expensive to rent. If we can't do that we're just going to polyurethane over the dirt, not really what I want to.\n\nWe're going to put a 10' wall between the two pillars to have a bit of privacy as well as a work wall for each of us. I'm also going to put up a cornered wall on wheels that will cover up the windows on my side. But I can always move it around if I need some light. Still not sure about this part. I might hinge it in some way instead. It feels a bit wrong to cover up the windows.\n\nAs things progress I get more and more excited...\n"

Most people don't know the actual title of the composition but have heard it in many a movie.\n\nIt was beautiful. The conductor (Bramwell Tovey) performed one his own compositions first, Urban Runway, as well as [Don Juan](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Strauss)>) by Richard Strauss. He was very vocal about his inspirations which at first I found a little more than I wanted to hear (on with the music, right?) but once the music started I found that I was really able, for the first time, to see how inspiration leads to music as opposed to an object. This may seem rudimentary to some but it was a valuable discovery for me. I was able to visualize the music. Big stuff.\n\nAnyway, the Bowl is beautiful.

I didn't have quite that experience but using a little hyperbole helps to place it a little more clearly (whatever that means).\n\nI started to experiment with the synthetic tar more, and believe me, it really looked like shit, literally and figuratively. It's not a hugh deal as I realize there is a long way to go when working towards a new vision but things become hard when you get to a point when you feel like you have no idea which way to go. Like you have no sense of what's good vs. what's not.\n\nIt's a bit unnerving at times but something I'm sure comes and goes.\n\nThe image above shows my doodle/blotter sketch while I was trying some airbrushing on a tar piece. Needless to say, it didn't work out the way I wanted (or else I would have shown it). I ended up gessoing over what I had done. I have some paper ready for next week. We'll see how things go. I have some thoughts.\n"

    "body": "\nI experienced my first earthquake yesterday, a 5.4. It was pretty scary and totally exciting. My expectations have been formed by what I've seen in movies but the actual event was very different. It was as if my apartment building was dropped into a large body of water. First there was a huge, but eerily silent vibration as if a big giant tripped and fell in our upstairs neighbor's apartment, and then the swaying back and forth like floating in a wave pool. Both E and I ran into the center of the apt and stood under the hallway doors while staring at each other with wide eyes. My first thought was \"what the hell just hit our building?\". We quickly figured out that we were having an earthquake and then I was suddenly worried that I had no shoes on and my toes were going to get cut off.\n\nThe apt. silently swayed for about 10 seconds after the initial shake in a very smooth, aquatic nature. Looking out our open windows really heightened the effect as the view was going back and forth. I remember seeing a women out on the sidewalk with a stroller cruising along as if nothing had happened. It made me second guess my understanding of what just happened for a millisecond, \"wait, maybe something did hit us!\".\n\nAfterwards, I called my mom because I'm perpetually dead in a ditch somewhere if she hasn't heard from me even after a hard rain. I waited maybe five minutes to call her. By the time she picked up and I told her the news she had turned on the local news in Ohio which already had a story about it. Pretty damn fast.\n\nLater, at work in Santa Monica, I witnessed part of a power grid explode, taking all the electricity in the area with it. I've seen individual transformers blow on telephone poles but this was like something out of a movie. First there was an extremely loud electrocution noise, but on steroids, when I looked over at the grid I saw huge flames shooting into the air with the power of a rocket. Maybe 15 to 20 feet up. That lasted only a few seconds. Then an enormous, beige mushroom cloud, pushed sideways by the wind, came over the street. I got to go home early.\n\nIt was a very non-relaxing day to say the least.\n"

While the subject matter flirts with lulling viewers into an unconscious appreciation of violence, Batura evades this trick and instead carves out a nuanced if queasy place where pathos resides side by side with harmony, historic ideals of beauty are part and parcel with contemporary images of suffering, and the tension between attraction and revulsion remains pragmatically taut.\n"

One of the owners (2 brothers and if I remember correctly, they are are twins, at least fraternal, or they just looks a lot alike) told me that \"this guy is one of the best songwriters today\". So I bought [After Mathematics](http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gnftxqu0ldfe).\n\nIt has it's highs and lows, mostly due to the subject matter, _Love._ But on the whole, the lo-fi effect of the recordings give a distinct vibrancy, and yes, I have to agree, Graham is a great songwriter. Not only the lyrics, which are easily accessible, but the composition and instrumentation of the music as well. Like the Talking Heads who reclaimed Pop music during the 80's , Kleenex Girl Wonder contributed to the same effort in the late 90's-00's.\n\nHere's a good example via youtube off of \"Smith\", [Reunited Airlines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnPoyUOo4ZA) .

    "body": "\nI've been researching DSLRs the past couple of months to be as informed as possible before I drop 2k on one. After I decided on the [Nikon D90](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0808/08082702nikond90previewed.asp), my current digital cameras have seemed less than adequate (which of course they aren't).\n\nThey have served me quite well in fact. I bought my first one, the [Nikon Coolpix 995](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikoncp995/), in 2001, and I still use it today. I get a lot of laughs though because it's pretty big. One guy was so excited, when he saw me using it he asked \"Whoa, is that one of those old pocket TV's?\". Granted, it's large, but the split nature of the form has made difficult shots much easier than todays point-and-shoot cameras do with their static LCDs.\n\nNow that I see what I've been missing being unable to take advantage of different lenses, I'm having a hard time using a point-and-shoot camera. During my research I came upon an article at [kenrockwell.com](http://www.kenrockwell.com) about using the photo services of Costco to have his [film developed and scanned](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/free-digital-camera.htm). It still costs money but you get your film back and a CD that allows you to import them onto your computer. For some reason I had it in my head that I was going to have to scan everything manually if I used film. But if asked I would have answered that \"of course they scan a CD for you\".\n\nSo yesterday I took out my old [Nikon F3](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/f3.htm) that I've not used, except once, in the past few years and loaded it up with some some old 800 speed film. It was great! Feeling giddy, I shot every mundane thing I could find. The mechanics of manual photography started to come back to me in bits and pieces. One thing I remembered when I finished the roll was that you actually have to set the speed of the film using the camera's ISO dial. Oops! Just shot a roll of 800 using 100 ISO. No big deal. Fixed that on the next roll and actually got [some](/blog/2008/10/11/elizabeth-in-the-morning) [good](/blog/2008/10/11/bk-belfry) [pictures](/blog/2008/10/11/twine-and-bell) out of it.\n\nIt ended up costing $25 for two rolls with a CD for each. A little pricey but very worth it if you plan on printing large-scale. I did have to do a little white balancing and Gaussian blurring in Photoshop as I didn't use any filters while shooting and the 800 film was pretty grainy in some of the shots, but hey, I do that anyway.\n\nSo long story short, if you still have an old SLR (and a little cash), grab some film and go to town.\n"

There is usually a consistent level of noise coming in from the street, mostly from people calling out to friends or screaming at enemies. The choir was a welcomed reprieve. But, only for a while. They would carry the same tune about Jesus for 10 minutes before changing to another song about, well, guess who... yes, Jesus. The subject matter wasn't really the issue though. It was more that instead of just repeating the whole song, they only repeated the refrain. Over and over again. What's worse is that they had a guy calling out the lyrics a few beats early. I think it was him that got me the most.\n\nBut really, it was still nicer than the alternative. I even opened the balcony door and windows so as to hear them better.

    "body": "\n![Wrapped in Pantyhose](images/wrapped-pantyhose1.jpg)\n\nUntitled and in-progress\n\nI spent more time in the studio this weekend. It feels like I'll soon be able to quit starting my posts with some form of the sentence/disclaimer about how I actually got some work done. It's part artist's guilt, part a need to update whomever is reading my posts and part a refusal to be nonchalant about how hard it has been to make progress on structuring my life around what I really want to accomplish. And as most artists that struggle to make time for the studio know, it's a big deal to get even one day a week in their studio.\n\nOk, no that I got that off my chest...\n\nAs I've mentioned multiple times before, I'm working through some works-in-progress from the past couple of years (boy, I still can't believe it's been that long). While at the the [UTD/Southside](/blog/2008/01/01/utd-southside-artist-residency) residency I finished a series entitled \"[Pets](/portfolio/2005/01/27/pets)\". At the time, I had edited a couple of pieces out of the series as the forms weren't quite right. I held onto them though, in the hopes that I would be able to find some sort of closure. The problem was that the forms had more of a subtractive quality to them as if they had been carved rather than being built from the inside-out (they were made with individual pieces that were wheelthrown and then put together with added handbuilt forms). I wanted to see if I could bring back an expansive quality by adding to them. In way, I liked the fact that this let me take more risks since if the pieces failed, it wouldn't have been too much of a big deal. Besides, the hard part was over, the firing. I hate firing clay, something always goes wrong and you end up losing a ton of work.\n\nI've wanted to work with pantyhose since graduate school (do you see my serious face?). First, as way to realize forms I would later make into pots, then, as I moved out of making pots and fired clay in general, as a way to alter preexisting forms. The only thing I'd done with it so far were the [Teapots Altered](/portfolio/2006/04/17/teapots-altered) piece. So this weekend I took what was leftover and stretched them over the piece shown above. It wasn't easy and I ripped it in a few places where the clay was a little sharp. Once I got both of them on I showed it to E and she recommended trying silk instead of nylon. I agreed. I wanted more of a sensual look to the form. Getting misshapen forms to look sensual has a lot to do with what I working towards in general.\n\nSo what you see above is a first draft. I've got a list of things to get for next go-at-it and I always like buying pantyhose (not that it's a regular habit, and not that there would be anything wrong that...).\n\n![Clay Study](images/clay-study.jpg) The swoopy number is a clay study for another [wall prosthetic](/portfolio/2006/03/01/untitled-wall-prosthetic). Most of my ideas for this body of work are moving towards pattern and repetition. I always hesitate with repetition (to a fault at times) because it's so often abused . The formula usually goes \"Hey, that's a great piece I made there, but I really need something to fill a gallery... I know, I'll just make a shitload of 'em. Awesome!\".\n\nI'm a little fuzzy on why I'm looking for more pattern/repetition but the wall prosthetic currently in-progress should give me a better idea as to whether or not I'm going in the right direction.\n\nNow I need to get ready for camping. E and I are going [Joshua Tree](http://www.nps.gov/jotr/) for Thanksgiving and from what I've seen, the place looks great. I just hope we don't freeze our asses off (btw, we're going to freeze our asses off).\n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n"

I had a really long week and went to bed every evening at around 9pm. Felt really nice to just fall into bed that early, knowing I didn't have to be up until 9pm the next morning.\n\nIt took all week to catch up on the sleep I missed out on while camping in Joshua Tree last weekend. And yes, we really did freeze our F#@king asses off. More so than I imagined. We only had two thin blankets each and the nighttime temp was at least 40°. Doesn't sound too cold, but believe me, it was.\n\nI'll post some pics soon. I had them ready to go but my trial on [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) ran out before I could export them. Now I need to come up with $ to buy the app (which is very worth it). When that happens, many a beautiful picture will be posted.\n\nSo, my Sunday (and Saturday) has been spent making websites. I never post much about it because I don't think most people want to read about coding, but I found the above image nice enough to post.\n\nThe application I use is called [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and it allows you to customize the look of different types of code. After spending a while working in black on white I switched to light on dark. Over the years I have tweaked the colors to suit my needs which is what your seeing, my personal theme. Kinda corny, but pretty none the less.\n\nI've also been working on a new version of this site's design and functionality. Hopefully I'll be able to finish it over the holidays (I'm pretty far along). That is, when I get my client work done. I have at least two weeks off for the holidays and I plan on spending the days in my studio and the nights on web development.\n"

This water putty stuff is really great. It's similar to plaster but with higher tinsel strength. I had learned about it from the facilities guys at my last job. They were using it instead of wood putty. We'll see how it sands out.\n\nI also did some sketches with ink and water. The color from my favorite one (which sorta looks like a dong) came from the unwashed interior of the squeezie thing with which I applied a big puddle of water to the paper. Once the puddle had a shape that worked, I added black ink by touching a wooden, ink-saturated skewer tip to the surface. I really like the results.\n"

Of course, I rarely paid attention to grammar, and writing in general, when I was in school. Writing a paper was like getting a root canal without anesthesia. Not because it was just a lot of work, I just had such a hard time holding focus on an idea through pages of writing.\n\nUsing a computer to compose my writing has made things much easier. Each sentence feels less cemented in its position (in my head, at least). They feel more like building blocks that I can easily rearrange in whatever order needed to build my prose.\n\nAfter pages and pages of handwriting I would lose my direction and end up scrapping the whole thing. Every wrong turn only compounded the problems with the only solution being starting over from the beginning.\n\nOutlines were just posturing as far as I was concerned. Thinking about now, I would have had a much easier time with all of this if I'd taken a class that was solely dedicated to building outlines.\n"

I tend to try to think my way through problems instead of working through them. This is usually because I can't get to the studio. While thinking is a necessity, there is no substitute for working (in my case, at least).\n\nLast night I finished the above drawing, started months ago. Actually, I simply put something down on paper months ago and then, last night, covered it up with what you see above. They do relate though, in that I wasn't starting from a blank piece of paper and the resulting drawing is a reaction, in part, to what I was trying to initially make, which was very different.\n\nWorking this way feels right (drawing with wet media). The process is immediate, which is something I need after long neglecting working in the studio. It also has remnants of the instant gratification I used to get while working in clay.\n"

    "body": "\nAnother excellent post over at David Byrne's blog where he ruminates on the effect of viewing art, making art and personal anecdotes of growing up in Baltimore. His argument seems to fizzle as he gets to his own experience, though it's still worth reading.\n\n> However, one thing led to another and connections, sometimes bizarre, were made. I painted a picture in high school of a phalanx of identical businessmen (who may have resembled my dad a bit), in a style reminiscent of George Tooker (I realize now) – standing against a wall of brightly colored, abstract empty picture frames and on a floor decorated with Northwest Indian tribal images, with hook-beaked creatures and densely packed biomorphic forms. It could have been a psychedelic record cover, and it referenced, or maybe simply imitated, everything visually available to me in suburban Baltimore that seemed wild and cool.\n\nvia [David Byrne Journal: 05.17.09: Art is good for you?](https://davidbyrne.typepad.com/db/page/16#entry-67282051).\n"

    "body": "\nI've been doing a lot of drawing/painting lately. It is definitely a new experience for me. I first started out thinking that everything I began was going to have and end, that is, a mostly successful end. Instead, I've learned that everything has a peak at which point I have to make a decision about whether to keep going, or not.\n\nAt first I just kept reaching these peaks, recognizing them and then trying to further elaborate in the hopes of finding some plateau that reached throughout the dimensions of the paper. This lead to a lot of paint-overs with nothing to look to for guidance on aspects that were working. I finally let go of my original assumption. The following sketches represent small successes that I want to keep as reference for the next works.\n\nThough these have many shortcomings, I wanted to write about as to what I feel is working.\n\nBtw, I'm not all that great at photographing flat work as most of my experience is in 3D. Gonna brush up on it, pronto.\n\n![](images/sketches-7.jpg \"sketches-7\")\n\nWhat I've found the hardest is giving edge to a form. The above represents some small success towards that end. I spent a lot of time redefining the edge while leaving traces of the previous attempts. The bottom of the left hump shows this the best.\n\n![](images/sketches-9.jpg \"sketches-9\")\n\nThe different densities of black and the the white seeping into/onto the form start to give it some volume and weight. I also like the simplified handling of the edge.\n\nThe wetness of the paint is something that I found to be pretty exciting. Having to deal with a vertical working surface has added some limits that forces me to be more strategic in how I go about things.\n\n![](images/sketches-8.jpg \"sketches-8\")\n\nA little more edge articulation. I'm starting to really like painting wet on wet. When I start making marks I can feel a distinct window before things get muddled.\n\n![](images/sketches-6.jpg \"sketches-6\")\n\nI've been putting 6 or 7 blank sheets on the wall and making some marks to get the ball rolling. This one sat a long while until I was ready to add to the initial marks. The next attempt (the dark marks) had so much going on that I put it aside. The way the light marks relate the dark gives the whole a weight and clunkiness that's just right.\n\n![](images/sketches-5.jpg \"sketches-5\")\n\nCartoonishness is a delicate balance for me. While I feel this a bit too far (and belies my influences), I was able to restrain it.\n\nThe figure ground relationship feels more solid here as well.\n\n![](images/sketches-3.jpg \"sketches-3\")\n\nThis started out in the same vain as the first image. In dividing the white form I was able to create an outside section that appears to be resting on the section outlined in black, all the while acting as one form.\n\n![](images/sketches-2.jpg \"sketches-2\")\n\nCompleting the top form with collage. This is something I want to do more of.\n\n![](images/sketches-1.jpg \"sketches-1\")\n\nMore balancing of the cartoonishness. A lot more restrained with simple oval forms interlocking to create weight. Trying some pattern on the inside as well. This adds to the effect of weight but becomes simply a pattern when looked at directly.\n"

The main differences were that I was still in LA (and it was just as dirty), my cell phone was transformed into a kids space-age (for the 50's) toy and instead of a skateboard, I had to use a couch pillow (no, it didn't float and I ruined it on my first ride).\n\nThe only reason I'm explaining this is because when I opened my feed reader this morning this [picture](http://www.shorpy.com/node/6785?size=_original) from [Shorpy](http://www.shorpy.com) came up. Coincidence?\n"

    "body": "\nEvery time I show this [famous photo](http://www.photography-collection.com/uploaded_images/shulman_web-759706.jpg) by Julius Shulman I always expect the response \"Oh yeeeeeeah, I've seen that a million times\". I have yet to get that response out here in LA (where the house is located).\n\nBesides its prevalence during my art schooling, my mother had a few art books around the house that always employed this photo to represent modernism in architecture. It just became hard-wired into my brain and I thought the same for others.\n\nThis came to mind while explaining to a friend how E and I went on a hunt to find the house. Unfortunately, it is on a private drive in the Hollywood hills. After confronting the gate and going back and forth on the decision to jump the fence (in which my better judgment won out...), we drove around to see if we could get any sort of view. We did. It was the bottom of the corner of the house that hangs over the hill (the focus of the photo). There is a little cul-de-sac just below it where I was psyched (pitifully enough) that I was able to see even that much. While E sat in the truck and indulged me, I stood at the bottom of the hill and stared up at the little chunk of history.\n\nThey offer tours now but the idea just doesn't strike me as exciting as just walking into the backyard at night (albeit, trespassing).\n\n[The photo's back story](http://www.photography-collection.com/2009/07/architectural-photographer-shulman-dies.html)\n\n[http://www.stahlhouse.com/](http://www.stahlhouse.com/)\n"

I'm not sure where I stand but it's definitely worth discussing.\n\n> I suggested that it was more important that children, and everyone really, be imbued with a sense that they themselves might make things — that the things they might make have value — as opposed to learning mainly to appreciate the great masters, whether they be Bach, Picasso or the literary canon. I proposed that the value of art might be of more use to society in that regard, rather than focusing on supporting, well, museums and symphony halls. Naturally, to a senator who has made it her noble mission to argue for more support for the arts, this is slightly heretical and, as she said, “very American.”\n\nI wonder how much money would be wasted trying to imbue uninterested students \"with a sense that they themselves might make things\" other than bongs in ceramics class.\n"

The above detail was a failed attempt which yielded a nice surprise.\n\nI used liquid latex (used for applications similar to wax resist in ceramics) that I'd dyed blue. I've had this stuff sitting around for ever (I used it for glazing pots) and dyed it blue to make it stand out more on unfired glaze. I figured I could use it to build a little moat that I could pour liquid in. Well, it didn't work. The paper buckled and the moat wasn't high enough to contain the liquid. It also cracked like a desert floor before the liquid evaporated.\n\nEven though it didn't go as planned there are some nice effects. The blue seeped into the paper and the liquid created some really great edges where the color pooled up against the latex. I've bought a stretched canvas and a clayboard for more tests. This should eliminate the buckling problem.\n"

    "body": "\nIn terms of web design, light text on a dark back ground can give some dynamic results. When it comes to reading on the web though, I prefer the reverse. What happens, especially when the scenario is white text on a black background, is that similar to looking into a bright light, the text can become \"burned\" into my vision very briefly. As I end a line of text and start to wrap back, the ghost text stays with me and takes a sec to fade away. Needless to say, it can make reading very unpleasant.\n\nThere are a few simple tricks I use to alleviate this issue.\n\n1. Write my own stylesheet for the browser with simple defaults to make the background and text reversed. Not my first choice as I usually want to experience the intended design first. Find out more about [user stylesheets](http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=UserStylesheets).\n2. Use the excellent [Readabilty bookmarklet](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/). I use this on most news sites to remove all the blinking ads. It's not prefect though. It has trouble saving the inline images and doesn't work with paged articles, which so many sites use to gain more ad revenue.\n3. Or the simple shortcut (on Mac only) of Control + Option + Command + 8. While it seems long it's actually pretty simple. This command can be toggled quickly and is therefore my favorite.\n\nExample: [Perishable Press](http://perishablepress.com), a well designed and excellent source of WordPress and general web development tips.\n\nBefore the key command:\n\n![Normal view](images/normal.jpg \"Normal view\")\n\nAfter the key command:\n\n![Inverted view](images/inverted.jpg \"Inverted view\")\n\nAnd if you forget the key command you can always visits your Mac's system preferences and make the change.\n\n![Preferences dialog](images/preferences.jpg \"Preferences dialog\")\n\nWhile this makes reading easier on the web, I actually use light text on a dark background when I'm coding. Seems counter intuitive but I've found it preferable. I need to think a bit more about why it makes such a difference...\n\nExample using [TextMate](http://macromates.com)'s Blackboard theme (modified):\n\n![TextMate Blackboard theme](images/TM-blackboard.jpg \"TextMate Blackboard theme\")\n"

    "title": "Write a TextMate Command to Order your CSS Properties",

    "body": "\nI like to have my css property lists ordered by string length (smallest to largest). Some my find it fussy but I feel they are easier to read when formatted this way. Looking at this stuff all day makes my eyes pretty tired and I'll do whatever I can to improve things.\n\n[TextMate](http://macromates.com) has a great feature called [Commands](http://manual.macromates.com/en/commands). These are essentially small programs you can write using common programming languages (I prefer php since it's the only one I know). You can invoke these commands using key shortcuts or tab triggers.\n\nSince I spend a lot of time formatting my css, I wanted to make it an automated process that I could fire off using the key shortcut `option+return`.\n\nBe careful not to use an existing key shortcut when choosing your own. TextMate is smart enough to not overwrite the previous shortcut but instead shows you a contextual menu of the choices bound to the shortcut. This slows down the workflow, adding more steps to get the end result.\n\nStart by opening a new document and select Bundle Editor > Show Bundle Editor\n\n![command-1](images/command-1.jpg)\n\nWith the Bundle Editor open, select New Command. This will create a new command in whatever bundle was currently selected.\n\nI prefer to keep all my customizations in my own bundle. This makes it easy to keep the bundles current between my home and work machines. It also makes it easy to share with friends. To create your own bundle simply select the \"New Bundle\" menu item first. Then add a \"New Command\" to it.\n\n![command-2](images/command-2.jpg)\n\nGive the new command a descriptive title.\n\n![command-3](images/command-3.jpg)\n\nNext, select what input you'd like. This is what gets passed to your command from the document. Choose \"Selected Text\" with a fallback of \"Scope\". For the output, choose \"Replace Selected Text\". You can also use \"Show as Tool Tip\" while debugging. This simply pops up a yellow tool tip showing you the result.\n\n![command-4](images/command-4.jpg)\n\nTextMate tracks the location your cursor to determines it's scope. For instance, if you're in-between the enclosing braces in a css rule, TextMate will determine the scope as `meta.property-list.css`. You can check the scope of the current cursor location using the key shortcut `shift+control+p`.\n\nWe want to edit the order of a css property list so we'll need to use `meta.property-list.css` as our scope. This way, TextMate will pass us all the properties inside the enclosing braces, including the braces.\n\nWe also need to choose our activation method. We want a \"Key Equivalent\" for this so click inside the input field and press the key shortcut you'd like to use. The input field will record your actions and show the shortcut using the associated key icons.\n\n![command-5](images/command-5.jpg)\n\nTo start using a specific language in your command you need to let TextMate know where to look. `#!/usr/bin/php` is the default path to the php executable on a mac running Snow Leopard.\n\nOpen the php declaration with `<?php` and start coding.\n\nMake sure there is no empty lines between the php path and opening declaration. If there is, this will get returned to your document in the form of an unwanted newline character. This drove me batty until a helpful person replied to my question on the [TextMate mailing list](http://lists.macromates.com/listinfo/textmate).\n\n![command-6](images/command-6.jpg)\n\nHere's the tricky part, getting the input parsed out from the STDIN (standard input) constant. I referred to this [excellent explanation](http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2007/03/19/using-php-cli-for-textmate-commands/) for help. To see other data to which you have access, use `print_r($_ENV)`. This shows an array of goodies you can use in in your command.\n\n**\\[updated 12.13.09\\]** - [Allan Odgaard suggested](http://old.nabble.com/Unwanted-newline-php-td26739354.html#a26767978) using `file_get_contents(\"php://stdin\")` instead of `$fstat = fstat(STDIN); $stdin = fread(STDIN, $fstat['size']);` The updated command can be downloaded using the same download link at the end of the article.\n\n![command-7](images/command-7.jpg)\n\nHere is the full commented code for the command.\n\n```php\n#!/usr/bin/php\n<?php\n\n// Get the properties list\n$stdin = file\\_get\\_contents(\"php://stdin\");\n\n// remove the enclosing brackets\n$pattern = '/\\\\{(.\\*)\\\\}/Us';\npreg\\_match($pattern, $stdin, $matches);\n\n// Trim off the whitespace\n$match = trim($matches\\[1\\], \"\\\\n\");\n\n// Turn each line into a member of an array\n$match = preg\\_split('/\\\\n/', $match);\n\n// Check the string length of each member.\nfunction sort\\_strlen($val\\_1, $val\\_2) {\n       // initialize the return value to zero\n       $retVal = 0;\n\n       // compare lengths\n       $firstVal = strlen($val\\_1);\n       $secondVal = strlen($val\\_2);\n\n       if($firstVal > $secondVal) {\n               $retVal = 1;\n       } else if($firstVal < $secondVal) {\n               $retVal = -1;\n       }\n\n       return $retVal;\n}\n\n// Iterate through the array using the preceding function to organize the array.\nuasort($match, \"sort\\_strlen\");\n\n// Wrap the finished product in braces.\n$output = '{' . \"\\\\n\";\nforeach($match as $line) {\n\t$output .= $line . \"\\\\n\";\n}\n$output .= '}';\n\necho($output);\n?>\n```\n\nNow that I have added my command and if my cursor is located inside a properties list, I can invoke it using `option+return`.\n\nHere is what my properties looks like before the command:\n\n![command-8](images/command-8.jpg)\n\nAnd after:\n\n![command-9](images/command-9.jpg)\n"

It came out with some really interesting qualities. Overall it has been the most successful. I muddied the ink too much though. After I added the ink I started to blow it around in the puddle thinking it might not spread it out enough on its own. As a result, the red mixed too much with the black. Oh well. Still good results, if a bit bloody (maybe that's a good thing...).\n\nMy studio neighbor came in and said \"Ah! Meaty.\" After looking at it for the past few days, I would agree. The pinning of canvas gives a strung-up-hide look as well.\n\nThe drawing is a bit goofy. It's weird how I find myself gravitating towards these forms. They have commonalities with some of the things I'm looking to get across but are way off the mark. I blame graffiti-laden Los Angeles. It looks as if I sat down and copied it off the side of the highway somewhere. I see this stuff so much that it sometimes seeps in without notice.\n\nHonestly, I feel somewhat insecure posting the state the drawing so far. It communicates a very immature idea of what I'm trying to work towards.\n"

    "title": "What Passes for Art Review in the L.A. Times",
    "url": "/blog/2009/12/19/what-passes-for-art-review-in-the-l-a-times",
    "body": "\nOne area I find severely lacking in L.A. is the standard of critical discourse. More specifically, the Los Angeles Times art reviews. I don't believe I've read an actual review since moving here 2+ years ago. They're called \"reviews\" of course, but they're really just play-by-play descriptions of the physical properties of each. work. in. the. show...\n\nIf I wanted to know what the works looked like before visiting the show I would look to the excellent blogs [tryharder](http://try-har-der.blogspot.com/ \"tryharder\") or [The Flog](http://the-flog.com/ \"The Flog.\"). Both of which publish images of work from L.A. based shows.\n\nI understand the need for description, people want to visualize the work in deciding whether to visit. It's also needed to support the reviewer's thoughts/reactions. But when the article is 80-90% descriptive fluff, It gets absurd. Take this [review](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/12/art-review-nathaniel-de-large-at-cirrus-gallery.html) on the Nathaniel de Large show at Cirrus Gallery by David Pagel. Out of 464 words, I can only find 66 (two sentences) that come close to a thoughtful reaction. The rest are just fluff. And I say \"close to a thoughtful reaction\" because the reviewer didn't actually give his reaction. He's used that tried and true formula of describing the reader's (imagined) reaction instead: \\[emphasis mine\\]\n\n> \"**You** find **yourself** rooting for De Large's bubbles, hoping that each one lasts longer than it does.\"\n\nExcept I, as the reader, haven't seen the show. How does he know I'm \"rooting for De Large's bubbles\". He doesn't. And I'm not. I'm rooting for the reviewer to tell me what _he's_ rooting/not rooting for. I'll make up my mind about the bubbles if and when I see the show.\n\nAs an aside, I'm reminded of book reports I wrote during secondary education, working as hard as possible to fill the page requirement by simply describing the plot. Every once in a while I would have to put in some sort of reaction to fulfill the paper's requirement but kept it to minimum as the slippery slope of defending that position was steep, being a sophomore who was insecure about his own interpretation and all.\n\nThe second sentence of the 66 words I referred to earlier is in the first person, but once again, the reviewer employs another tactic to diffuse responsibility for his thoughts, using the plural \"us\" instead of the singular _me_.:\n\n> \"With a deft touch, De Large gets viewers to experience the world as a loopy adventure, a meandering journey filled with serendipitous twists and wonderful turns that keep us on our toes, almost dancing.\"\n\nNow the reader and the reviewer are complicit in a conclusion that only the reviewer has determined. A good analogy for this type of relationship would be a stranger ordering for you at a restaurant. It's absurd but yet, according to the reviewer, we're now \"almost dancing\" through \"a loopy adventure\". No I'm not. Besides, I don't dance (unless I get really inebriated).\n\nI slog through 402 words of fluff in the anticipation of a reaction and this is all I get? What a let down.\n\nThe substitution of reader for reviewer is a widespread problem. It's becoming rare when a reviewer writes in the first person.This substitution is perfectly absent in the recent [review](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2009/12/21/091221craw_artworld_schjeldahl#ixzz0a63WnxYH \"The sculpture and work of Gabriel Orozco : The New Yorker\") on the Gabriel Orozco retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art by Peter Schjeldahl \\[emphasis mine\\]:\n\n> \"Crisp, diagrammatic layouts of exfoliating circles and arcs, on white grounds, the paintings have few fans among critics. **I** sure don’t like them, although Orozco’s patient remark in their defense gives **me** pause: “People forget that I want to disappoint.” That strategy, targeting “the expectations of the one who waits to be amazed,” has worked well for him. **I** vividly remember being outraged in the proverbial manner of a philistine exposed to modern art when, for his first solo gallery show in New York, in 1994, Orozco displayed, on the walls of the main room at Marian Goodman, nothing but four Dannon yogurt lids. **I** recovered, by and by, to take the artist’s point, which amounted to disappointment as aesthetic therapy.\n\nWhat I take away from this passage, among other things, is the reviewer's voice, Schjeldahl's voice. Something I can use as context when viewing Orozco’s retrospective, and however my opinion differs from, or is similar to, Schjeldahl's, it will inform my reading of his next review. Trust is what's at stake here and a reader to reviewer relationship is the only way that trust is built.\n\nI read reviews for the reactions of the reviewer. It's not the job of the reviewer to be objective. They're not covering some police scandal or wreak on the 405 where a clear dissemination of the facts is critical. They're expressing opinions. Opinions on art where only an experienced and informed reviewer can make a difference.\n\nI'm not trying to pick on Pagel in particular. This style of art review in the L.A. Times is the standard. Writing what one actually thinks seems to be non-exisitant. It's frustrating.\n\nSince moving to L.A. I've been working to get to know the art scene. This means going to shows, reading reviews, following blogs and tweets, etc. There's a lot to like. Artists have maintained an enviable community. Lot's of large and small galleries that draw good sized crowds, grouped into distinct neighborhoods located all over the city. Co-ops like [The Public School](http://la.thepublicschool.org/home) that host classes by and for the arts community (or any community really, since you can propose anything), help to keep the arts grounded in a city that could be described as anything but.\n\nI expect the same from L.A. dominate source of arts coverage.\n"

    "body": "\n![](images/nice-surprise.jpg \"nice-surprise\")\n\nThe surface of one of my studio tables\n\nWhile trying to get some organization and cleanliness to the studio I noticed an interesting intersection of a few attempted drawings. Often, the liquid I pour looks to escape it's drawing surface (usually paper) and blaze a slow and disheartening trail across my table. The above image is evidence that this can sometimes be a good thing.\n\nIn most cases I do a single pour and leave it at that, but after multiple floods, I see the result has a more layered, intricate and detailed composition. I need to be more controlled about where and when I pour so as to be open to adding more, if needed.\n\nAs I write this I'm wondering what my fascination is with the effects of poured liquid on paper. I'm going to think on that more.\n\nAnyway, today I'm buying wood for 2 new studio tables. The current tables, the first, made over 10 years ago from recycled wood and sitting atop wheels from a mainframe computer (which I found in a dumpster) and the other, a door on plastic saw horses, have reached their limit. I'm pretty excited as I'm building out of necessity instead of habit.\n\nIn the past I would totally outfit my studio before any work was made, spending a lot of time getting it just right and not making any work until it was. Since moving to Los Angeles, and having such a hard time finding affordable space, all I simply wanted to do was make work. That changed this week when the current setup started to get in the way. That's what I'm doing today. I'll post some images soon.\n"

This article summed it right up, [Javascript Square Bracket Notation](http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/square_brackets.html)\n\n> Javascript also offers an alternative property accessor notation using square brackets in a way that is similar to the way in which the indexed members of an Array are accessed, except that a string is used between the square brackets. This alternative notation is extremely powerful and useful but gets very little coverage in most books on javascript and that seems to leave novice javascript programmers unaware that they even have this option.\n\nUsing square bracket notation you can change this:\n\n```js\ndocument.body;\n```\n\ninto this:\n\n```js\ndocument['body'];\n```\n\nMore importantly though, you can use variables as function names:\n\n```js\nvar genericString = 'Hello, my name is Ryan.';\nvar stringMethod = 'split';\ngenericString[stringMethod](' ');\n// returns the array [\"Hello,\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"Ryan.\"]\n```\n"

Next one is delayed by 5 seconds');\n      $(this).dequeue('bodyQueue');\n    })\n    .delay(5000, 'bodyQueue');\n\n  // Add another\n  body.queue('bodyQueue', function () {\n    console.log('2nd function (delayed 5 seconds)');\n    $(this).dequeue('bodyQueue');\n  });\n\n  // Add another\n  body.queue('bodyQueue', function () {\n    console.log('3rd function');\n    $(this).dequeue('bodyQueue');\n  });\n\n  // Add another\n  body.queue('bodyQueue', function () {\n    console.log('4th function');\n    $(this).dequeue('bodyQueue');\n  });\n\n  // Add another and delay the \"bodyQueue\" queue by 5 seconds.\n  body\n    .queue('bodyQueue', function () {\n      console.log('5th function. Next one is delayed by 5 seconds');\n      $(this).dequeue('bodyQueue');\n    })\n    .delay(5000, 'bodyQueue');\n\n  // Add the last one\n  body.queue('bodyQueue', function () {\n    console.log('6th function (delayed 5 seconds)');\n  });\n\n  // Show the queued functions when the page loads\n  var queue = body.queue('bodyQueue');\n\n  console.log(\n    'There are ' + queue.length + ' functions left in the \"bodyQueue\" queue:'\n  );\n\n  console.log(body.queue('bodyQueue'));\n\n  // Add an event to fire the \"bodyQueue\" queue\n  body.click(function () {\n    // Run everything in the \"bodyQueue\" queue\n    body.dequeue('bodyQueue');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nWhat I've defined here is a queue with the name `bodyQueue`, attached it to the `body` element and added a series of functions. When the `body` element registers a `click` event, the callback runs `body.dequeue('bodyQueue')`, firing the queued functions in `bodyQueue`.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n[jQuery for Designers | API: queue & dequeue](http://jqueryfordesigners.com/api-queue-dequeue/)\n\n[jQuery in Action 2nd edition: Queuing functions for execution](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/ajax/jquery-in-action-Queuing-functions-for-execution.aspx)\n"

Textmate grabs that selected block\n4. opens a new file and sets it to the current language\n5. pastes in the block of code\n6. make all of your edits\n7. press the same key combo\n8. Textmate cuts the edited code\n9. closes the temp document\n10. replaces the original block of code with the updated version\n\nThat sounds like it would be pretty handy. When I get some time I'll try to create such a thing. Plus, I need to rework my [css property arranger](/blog/2009/12/11/write-a-textmate-command-to-order-your-css-properties).

His low brow rap name (Ninja), Pink Floyd shorts and homemade tattoos belie the controlled, high production values of the video.\n\nNo idea what's up with the dj. In the first video he's seems as if he's slow and has no idea what the hell's going on. In the second, he's portrayed by \"progeria sufferer Leon Botha, a prominent Cape Town artist\" \\[which [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Antwoord#Background) told me\\].\n\nAnyway, fixated.\n\nThey're somewhere between performance and spectacle. They've manufactured a very seamless persona and created other, totally opposite personas as well, like [MaxNormal.tv](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRy6pBpwVbk). This [interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeXiZ1HCONQ) shows a bit more of the difference.\n\nI first heard of them via BoingBoing. Give 'em a watch.\n"

When you’re talking on the phone, nothing is conveyed. There’s an awkward silence punctuated by the interviewer letting the interviewee know that it’s OK that they’re not talking while they think about it. People get more nervous, and I think it hurts the quality of their answers.\n\n[Interviewing over Skype](http://rc3.org/2010/05/18/interviewing-over-skype/)\n"

Together they look like hieroglyphics but as I drew them they were just forms and compositions that had been swimming around.\n\nI remember the _Art of the Maya_ class I took in graduate school having a big effect on me and I still have a few of the books lying around. After I hung these, I looked through one of them again. I couldn't place any specific form but some of them definitely had an overall quality that showed a close relationship.\n\n* * *\n\nI've been thinking a lot about over-thinking my work (no pun intended). The self-impossed requirement to understand what will come after the very thing I have yet to make has been paralyzing.\n\nI don't have a big drive to explain my work but yet it seems obligatory in the current environment. I love a great story but when it involves the purported meaning behind an art object or experience, I usually tune it out as it's often heavy-handed and trite. A contrived story can really kill a good piece and a bad piece is rarely helped by a great story. But yet, they persist and it sells.\n\nMaybe it gives people something to hang onto while they let themselves absorb the work. I know I've been guilty of this in relationships. It takes time to get to the heart of something and in the meantime I'll create a story that gives me some foundation while I work out what's real and meaningful from what's superfluous and distracting.\n\nNo answers are forthcoming here, but the stream-of-consciousness drawings above help me cut through to something that is actually helpful.\n"

It teaches us that “intelligence” is a motley assortment of heuristics, kludges, and cheap tricks. The danger with AI is not that machines will become smarter than us, but that we will become as dumb as machines. The absurdly prescient William S. Burroughs was wise to this fifty years ago. “The study of thinking machines teaches us more about the brain than we can learn by introspective methods,” pronounces Dr. Benway, in 1959’s Naked Lunch. “Western man is externalizing himself in the form of gadgets.”\n\nIt's going to take a handful of reads to really wrap my head around it, but the first has proven entirely enthralling.\n"

    "body": "\n![](images/img.jpg \"img\")\n\nScanned and altered photograph\n\nAmong all the projects ongoing (and collecting dust) in my studio, I've been thinking about a photo series as well. With the recent purchase of a Hasselblad and the long hours at my day job, making photographs has been the most accessible creative output for which I've been able to make time.\n\nI use my cameras for many reasons, but one that has been standing out more often is that of recording something I later want to use in a drawing. The process has been feeling less successful lately. While the photos have been making more sense, the taking-things-from-photos-and-trying-to-replicate-them-on-paper part hasn't been working out. It's just felt like poor copies, some part never quite transfers to the paper. It could be my lack of proficient materials handling (I really suck at it) where in I'm actually trying to replicate something instead of just pushing materials around until I'm pleased with the result. Or it could be that whatever it is I'm trying to transfer loses all integrity when outside of its environment. It's probably a little of both.\n\nSo I thought that maybe what I really want is to draw on the photos directly. To this end, friend and coworker Cris Stritmatter was nice enough to give me 2 hours of his time to show me some of the techniques for photo compositing in Photoshop. The above image is the result.\n\nLayer blending, layer masks and brushes haven't really made their way into may skill set in all the years I've been using Ps. One of the hardest parts will be losing that \"photoshopped\" feel. That wasn't necessarily the goal of Cris's demo, but I believe it will be the most challenging piece. The suspension of disbelief is key for these to be successful.\n"

    "body": "\n_I'm in Bangalore, India on a 2 week trip for my job (web development) and am trying to keep a log of my thoughts and experiences.This is the first installment of images, with [more to come](/blog/tag/first-trip-to-india/)._\n\n_This is my first time out of the US (except for Niagara Falls, but that doesn't count) and am looking forward to seeing a totally different culture._\n\n![](images/2010-11-07-at-14-57-45.jpg)\n\nView from the window outside of my room.\n\n**begin rant**\n\nThe flights from LAX -> Heathrow -> Bangalore were pretty cramped (23 hours in total), but not as uncomfortable as I’d imagined (I'm not a small dude). There was a seat hustler (my own term) trying to get my bulkhead isle seat with some story that he just wanted to sit next to his brother. Or at least that is what I thought he said. He was grinning ear to damn ear while explaining, so I couldn’t really make all of it out. My inner Samuel L. Jackson was screaming “Yeah right, motherfucker!”. I later realized he didn’t even know the other dude. He got me back by hitting me with his fat ass/fanny pack every time he got in and out of his seat.\n\nI’m going for the upgrade on the way back.\n\nThe cabs here = fucking mad men! It’s no wonder, the highways have yellow and black racetrack striping on each side. My guy was doing 120+ kilometers/hour all the way here. Usually not a big deal as it’s around 75-80 miles/hr, but there were cars and motorcycles all over the road. I knew inner city traffic was bad here, but I didn’t realize they also drive like nut-jobs on the highways. (If your name is Becky Fitzer, please skip to the next paragraph). We almost got smushed by multiple buses and came about 3 inches from taking out a motorcycle with 2 people on it. And I actually mean 3 inches. I was pretty scared during that one. Not too mention the numerous red lights he ran and dirt shoulders he drove onto to get in front of everyone so he could run said red lights.\n\nAnd the horns? WTF!? They beep at each other like a fucking forest of birds during mating season. When it comes to the art of driving like shit these guys make American cabbies look like my damn grandma, _R.I.P._. And why do they have to straddle the lanes... constantly? Is picking a damn lane for wimps? I asked one of my Indian counterparts and he responded sarcastically with \"what do you mean, lanes?\".\n\n**end rant**\n\nSo, I’ve gotten about 3 hours of sleep in the past 42 hours. I’m sure the above made that clear. I hope I will crash tonight so I can get right on schedule sans lag. My chances are very good.\n\nSaw my first [head bobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ0SuD_ulVk)! Man, it's such a weird mannerism. At first I thought it was just something done for foreigners sake. It has a very non-committal quality that would work well to put one at ease when you had no idea what they were saying. But, they also respond to each other they same way. It's more convoluted that I thought. I look forward to many more.\n\nEveryone is so polite. Feels weird as it has the opposite effect on me. I feel like I’m imposing even more. I guess it’s all that genetically inherited colonialist white man’s guilt.\n\nThe classy vinyl wood flooring in my room (its uncanny resemblance to cheap-ass maple is exquisite) is freezing cold. And what I can only imagine is a cruel joke, the flexible Styrofoam® slippers they provide to walk around the cold floor barely even fit on my big toe. Needless to say, but my feet feel like little 5-headed kings.\n\nThe hotel buffet is great. The Indian food is very good to say the least. Plus, it came with a complimentary head and shoulder massage. The masseur spent most of his time on my head and I walked out of there looking like some hairsprayed-up glam rocker from the 80’s. Even worse, I went strait to the bathroom and then walked through the hotel lobby with the barn door wide open. My employer's reputation is in good hands.\n\nIt’s very green and lush here. Plus we are having a lot of rain. I have yet to see all the Bengalore skyscrapers. I feel like I’m pretty far away from the city. Hopefully there are some places to walk to.\n\nAnyway, good so far. Looking forward to meeting all my team members on Monday. I expect to be greeted by a sea of smiling mustaches. They take their facial hair very seriously out here. The hotel valet (really nice guy) looks as if chia pet exploded on his mouth. As an added bonus, he reminds me of every sword-wielding villain from Indian Jones.\n\n![](images/2010-11-07-at-14-39-43.jpg)\n\nWaiting for my new hairdo/massage session.\n\n![](images/2010-11-07-at-14-33-55.jpg)\n\nIt was Kids Day and the hotel had some entertainment, an Indian musician who played mostly Eric Clapton (and sounded dead-on) and a potter. I couldn't wait to give it try. The wheel is made with an old tire (the thick outer ring) and is powered by a big pole that fits into a hole where you spin it around.\n\n![](images/2010-11-07-at-14-34-05.jpg)\n\nMy pots are the 2 big ones in the back. He liked to fix my \"mistakes\" which was pretty interesting how are techniques differ. When I tried to make a shape I liked, he would interrupt with a \"no, no, no\" and do a little _Ghost_ move putting his hands over mine. I really wanted to take my shirt off at one point. He was great and let me play for a bit.\n\n![](images/2010-11-07-at-13-58-32.jpg)\n\nLittle desserts from the hotel's $56 buffet. They were very pretty and yummy.\n"

    "body": "\nSo much for my plan on keeping a day-to-day journal. My workload has pretty much kept me from doing any non-work related stuff during the weekdays, other than seeing India from the back of a taxi. Although, I did have a great driver, Srinivas, who helped me learn a little more about his country. Here are a few pics from Monday, day 2, from my 2 week [trip to Bangalore, India](/blog/tag/first-trip-to-india/).\n\n![](images/india.jpg)\n\nThis is the business park where the office is located. On the walk back from some really horrible coffee, I grabbed a blurry image of women recycling cardboard. The cardboard is neatly stacked, tied and balanced on their heads. Some stacks I saw were probably 3 feet thick.\n\n![](images/india-5.jpg)\n\nSome of the language differences amused me. \"Stick\" felt so harsh, while the below text reading \"Defaulters will be Prosecuted\" felt a bit formal.\n\n![](images/india-4.jpg)\n\nThese little hole-in-the-wall quickie marts were everywhere. And they always had a monkey-sized batch-o-nanners hanging around.\n\n![](images/india-3.jpg)\n\nFrom what I could gather, this was a little morning/evening pit stop for hungry commuters. I passed it every morning and evening. Always a good crowd.\n\n![](images/india-2.jpg)\n\nAn \"Auto Rickshaw\", or simply \"Auto\" for short (I asked, cars are simply called cars). Loud as shit, feisty as hell in traffic and a consistent belcher of black, sooty exhaust. I spent waay to much time behind these things. I'm sure I lost a few years of my life as a result. Next time you see me, just disregard the extra nostril on my forehead.\n\n![](images/india-1.jpg)\n\nThis woman, from I could tell, was employed as grounds keeper. When I snapped this I just thought she was picking up the pretty orange flowers for some decoration. The nicely woven basket sure didn't seem like a receptacle for trash. That still might be true as a lot of the cars, bikes and buses sported beautiful strung flowers across them, most likely for Diwali. But, as I drove by each day, she was doing other, similar tasks as well. Yesterday, as a result of a big rain, she was scooping water out of large puddles in the street and pouring into the bushes using a cutoff water bottle. A we drove by, Srinivas made sure not to splash her as she stared me down with a look of indifference. It was difficult to meet her eyes.\n"

    "title": "Two Sides to the Story of Support",
    "url": "/blog/2010/12/02/two-sides-to-the-story-of-support",
    "body": "\n#### Side one, the Developer\n\nTo the question:\n\n_\"Do the thanks and appreciation go anywhere near compensating the constant e-mail asking for support? What inspires your desire to give without return?\"_\n\n[Alex King](http://alexking.org/blog/2010/12/01/open-source-motivations) responded, in part, with this paragraph:\n\n> \"In talking with other plugin developers, it seems fairly universal that the reward for a successful plugin is a deluge of support email that includes the worst kind of sense of entitlement, rudeness and ignorance. The community as a whole seems to expect to be able to pay nothing, yet received expert and individual help and support for free.\"\n\nEvery time I've thought of releasing a plugin for WordPress (or jQuery), I've had to think through this same issue. It hasn't yet stopped me from releasing a plugin (I still have yet to release any, but they're in the works), but it definitely stakes a claim in the \"How\" of the decision making process.\n\nSo far I have yet to find a bulletproof solution. The 3 best options I've observed are:\n\n1. Directing all support to the WordPress forums via tagging.\n2. Directing all support to Alex King's [WordPress Help Center](http://wphelpcenter.com/).\n3. Create a subscription-based support structure as exemplified by Justin Tadlock's [ThemeHybrid](http://themehybrid.com/theme-club) and Ingenesis Limited's [Shopp Plugin](http://shopplugin.net/updates/support-access/).\n\nEven with one (or all) of these strategies in place, there are still going to be issues. Mostly, that you're not able to fully recoup your efforts managing support work (via payment and/or hours that could have been devoted to coding). Plus, it's not really that enjoyable, for _either_ party.\n\n#### Side two, The User\n\nAs a WordPress user, relying on free plugins that provide little or no support can get frustrating very quickly. I started using WordPress in 2005 and later joined the community in 2006. Not long after, I realized that relying on the free, forum-based support model was unsustainable. As a result, I quickly began contracting developers to write plugins I needed.\n\nMost users would be surprised to find that the cost of contracting a plugin is minimal, especially when compared against time spent in the forums asking and waiting for help. The range for a plugin (one that doesn't need to reinvent the wheel) is around $100-$400. I realize this price range could be prohibitive depending on your financial status, but I wasn't making much then (first job out of grad school and a heap of student loans).\n\n_To be sure, the forums are a great resource, staffed and frequented by a lot of excellent and helpful people. [I owe them for a good bit of help and have contributed back over the years](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/ryanfitzer)_\n\nChoosing a great developer is key. Their reputation and hourly rate isn't necessarily indicative of your potential cost. Great developers work quickly and have a vault of stored solutions they've developed over the years that will directly benefit your project's budget. An inexperienced developer charging half the hourly rate may take 4x as long to complete the job. Not to mention that the code quality may have you needing frequent fixes and upgrades as WordPress evolves.\n\nA few points in support of my opinion:\n\n- They're normally willing to give you a flat rate. This avoids any surprise overages.\n- They'll usually provide free support, especially if they feel it was their mistake or that they could have written the code to be more forgiving of certain edge cases.\n- They tend quote lower if your idea presents good challenge. Developers love to be challenged.\n- They usually will not charge for time spent learning something needed to code your solution.\n\nRegarding choosing a great developer, start by contacting the most prominent names in the plugin community. I've never had to go further than contacting 3 people for a given project. The best ones are always busy, but if your schedule is flexible you'll have more luck.\n\n_Small disclaimer, I am currently using Alex King's [WordPress Help Center](http://wphelpcenter.com/) for 2 large pieces of client work._\n"

The docking feature (named \"Visor\" and not to be confused with their other app of the same name) allows for a Finder window to animate in/out with a hotkey (`` ⌥` `` by default), or whenever I switch to the Finder app. And with tabs, I don't have to manage 50 different Finder windows any longer.\n    \n    It's priced reasonably at $15 and has a 14 day trial period. I'm sure I will be buying it.\n    \n- [Visor](http://visor.binaryage.com/ \"Visor is a system-wide terminal accessible via a hot-key\")\n    \n    I've been learning [Git](http://git-scm.com/ \"Git - Fast Version Control System\") lately ([github.com/ryanfitzer](https://github.com/ryanfitzer)) which involves a lot of Terminal.app usage. Like TotalFinder, Visor allows you to dock Terminal to your screen and animate it in/out with a hotkey (`^` by default).\n    \n    Free and open sourced at [github.com/darwin/visor](https://github.com/darwin/visor).\n    \n- [XRefresh](http://xrefresh.binaryage.com/ \"XRefresh provides browser refresh automation for web developers\")\n    \n    Refresh your page Firefox whenever a file changes. So, I give a path to my working directory (I use MAMP so it's \"/Applcations/MAMP/htdocs\") and whenever a file changes, Firefox simply refreshes. No more toggling back and forth between Textmate and Firefox, constantly hitting `⌘r` to refresh the changes just made. Working with 2 monitors makes this even easier since I can have Textmate running on one and Firefox on another. I never have to toggle over to see my changes.\n    \n    It is composed of an addon to Firebug and Ruby Cocoa (has a native OSX installer). Start the server via the command line with `xrefresh-server`, open a new Firefox window and watch with wonderment.\n    \n    You can also set it to soft-refresh any css updates to avoid page reloads.\n    \n    It's awesome, free and open sourced at [github.com/darwin/xrefresh](https://github.com/darwin/xrefresh).\n    \n- [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/index.html \"Tower - The most powerful Git client for Mac\")\n    \n    Since my Terminal skills (mostly it's my typing skills) are pretty rough I thought I'd also try a GUI for Git. I use [Versions](http://versionsapp.com/ \"Versions - Mac Subversion Client (SVN)\") for SVN and Tower has so far proven to be the equivalent for Git.\n    \n    It's currently free and in beta, but it will be priced once they have a solid release. I'm sure I'll buy it.\n    \n- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/ \"Alfred App\")\n    \n    Billed as a \"productivity application for Mac OS X, which aims to save you time in searching your local computer and the web\". And that's exactly what it is. I've used [Quicksilver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29 \"Quicksilver (software) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\") for years, but the original developer ceased updates a log time ago and the community has kept it (mostly) alive (you find a good build at [github.com/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy](https://github.com/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy/downloads)).\n    \n    I new I'd eventually have to find a replacement and [Andy Clarke](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/from_air_to_eternity/ \"From Air To Eternity | Stuff and Nonsense\") posted about Alfred this week.\n    \n    It's free and currently in beta. An intersting note on how they plan to make money giving it away for free their FAQ page states \\[emphasis mine\\]:\n    \n    > \"We can provide the Alfred core for free thanks to users who support it by purchasing the [Powerpack](http://alfredapp.com/powerpack \"Alfred App - Powerpack\"). **We also include affiliate codes in Amazon links**\"\n    \n    It's a great model and I'm interested to see it how it scales. I might buy the Powerpack, but I want to get familiar with the Alfred core first.\n    \n\nIf anyone has any other recommendations I'd love to hear it.\n"

    "body": "\nFor the past two Christmas Day dinners, Elizabeth and I have taken on making a new dish. It's become our little tradition since we don't normally travel to our respective families for the holidays. This year Elizabeth made a delectable apple pie and I made 5 mounds of veggie burger slop.\n\nAs a long-time vegetarian and lacking a tried and true veggie burger recipe, I've suffered through the store bought varieties and vicious bullying from hippies for too long. But a week or two ago I had a mind-blowing veggie burger from [The Griffin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-griffin-los-angeles 'The Griffin on Yelp.com') in Loz Feliz. This thing was heaven wrapped in a grilled cheese sandwich (which was the bartender's recommendation) and it cemented my decision that a veggie burger would be this year's immaculate conception and awesome spicy beans will have to wait till next year.\n\nMy work started on Christmas day at 3pm (at the grocery store, which took me 2 hours) and dinner was served at about 12:30am (so it was actually a day-after-Christmas Christmas dinner). E worked on her's, along with the sides, while I mad-scientist-ed my way through 4 of the 5 recipes, cutting, mixing, food processor-ing, onion-crying, dish washing, and repeating. There was no time for the fifth and I had to throw out the finished fourth mix because of adding 1 tbsp of concentrated veggie broth instead of the 1 tbsp of _\"instant veggie broth\"_ that was listed. E was like \"honey, that stuff's concentrated, which makes a _big_ difference\". To which I replied \"no way, it's all the same. I'm sure simply wrote it down incorrectly. It'll be fine\". Yeah, it wasn't fine.\n\nFor most of the spices and seasonings listed, I had little or no idea of their taste and contribution, especially when mixed with other unknown ingredients. Take for instance [Gravy Master](http://www.google.com/search?&q=gravy+master 'Google Results for Gravy Master'), I've never heard of the stuff. Well, now I know that mixed with soy sauce _and_ vegetable bullion it will be pretty overpowering due to all three having basically the same taste and high sodium content.\n\nThe problem was the process in which I came to the 5 recipes. Starting with 10 I found online and loaded into a [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AoOGzT4YyXMtdG5BZFZjcVU4c1FaNl9LMm01RnFCbEE&hl=en&authkey=CPKzrpEB), I proceeded to combine the deltas of similar listings, based on the main ingredients of beans, rice, oats, potatoes, tvp or tofu, into 5 golden recipes. I thought it was a good idea, but instead it caused the births of 5 horrible Franken-burger mounds. In the hands of someone with more experience this might have worked, but I was not _Him_.\n\nSo, determined not to give up, I did some more research and thought [this recipe looked pretty good](http://vegetarian.about.com/od/veggieburgerrecipes/r/spicybeanburger.htm 'Spicy Vegetarian Black Bean Burger'). Leaving out the ingredients I didn't have, I halved the amounts to get the following:\n\n1/2 egg\n1/4 onion, diced\n1/2 cup bread crumbs\n1/4 tsp cayenne pepper\n1 cup can black beans, drained\n\nI cooked this baby up, miniature-style, topped it with cheese, salt, black pepper and mustard and wrapped it in a toasted little wheat bun. Although a little plain (due to little seasoning), it was pretty tasty and had good texture and consistency. Much better than the last attempts.\n\nWith a mind to fix the plain taste, I went to the spread of seasonings and spices left out from Christmas day (I have no cupboard space for all this shit) and started smelling things to gauge their effect on the taste I still had in mouth. While a little strong and sweet in the bottle, the BBQ sauce talked to me, \"Just put a razor-thin coating of me on there and I promise it'll rock you world\" it said. I listened and so another mini-a-fied burger went into a bun, substituting the mustard with the recommended razor-thin coating of BBQ sauce ([I used Bull's-Eye Memphis Style](http://www.amazon.com/Memphis-Regional-Barbecue-18-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B003GTOJFE \"Amazon.com: Bull's-Eye Memphis Style Regional Barbecue Sauce\") as it was the only option with real sugar instead of HFCS).\n\nThe little voice in that bottle wasn't shitting me, this burger was awesome. I even took a [photo to capture its beauty](/blog/2010/12/28/the-best-damn-veggie-burger/).\n\nI'm pretty excited and so I'll be trying other additions to this base (including the grilled cheese wrapper!) and will update this post with any successful additions. Any recommendations will also be welcomed.\n"

    "title": "Language Constructs",
    "url": "/blog/2011/01/03/language-constructs",
    "body": "\nI had a very difficult time in my English classes. In fact, there was a period where I simply refused to attempt any writing assignments due to the stress I caused myself. This was the primary reason for many failed classes in high school. Thankfully, I managed to graduate and go on to do much better in college.\n\nIt was during 2005 I began programming and a surprising result has been a better appreciation in how the English language is defined and used. Like human languages, programming languages can be broken down into similar constructs of nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. It's not something I've looked into (someday I will), but I find that common devices in modern programming languages can be compared to simplified examples in human languages.\n\nSo yesterday, Elizabeth and I were discussing using the phrase \"that that\" in a sentence and how awkward it sounds in conversation, even though it's grammatically valid. When writing, I normally try to substitute \"which\" for the latter \"that\" (I'm usually not deft enough to do the same in conversation). The unintended side effect though, is the substitution can end up making the sentence read a little too formal and out of character. Most people I know, including myself, rarely use the phrase \"that which\" in conversation. Not that I judge a good writer by how well their writing mimics conversation, but formalities can interrupt and/or ruin otherwise good prose.\n\nInterested in how this phase functions in a sentence, I looked up the definition of \"that\". I learned the first instance of \"that\" serves as a pronoun, while the second as a conjunction.\n\nTake for instance this conversation:\n\n> Speaker One:\n> \n> _Why are you are always disrespectful towards me?_\n> \n> Speaker Two:\n> \n> _I'm not. You're just not smart enough to know when I'm right._\n> \n> Speaker One:\n> \n> _See? It is that, that I'm talking about._\n\nThe first that, the noun, is referring to Speaker Two's answer of I'm not. You're just not smart enough to know when I'm right..\n\nThe second that, the conjunction, acts as the clause connector, connecting It is that with I'm talking about.\n\nTo help me remember how these constructs work I like to try and relate them to something in the world of programming. It usually helps regardless of if I can find any similarities.\n\nHere what the conversation would look like as a hypothetical javascript program:\n\n```js\n/*\n================================\n= Define our variables upfront =\n================================\n*/\nvar pronoun = null;\nvar conjunction = \"that\";\n\nvar speak = function( message ) {\n\talert( message );\n};\n\t\n/* speakers */\nvar Ryan = {\n\trole: \"Speaker One\",\n\tspeak: speak\n};\n\nvar Chris = {\n\trole: \"Speaker Two\",\n\tspeak: speak\n};\n\n/*\n==========================\n= Begin the conversation =\n==========================\n*/\n\n/* Ryan defines and speaks his question */\n\nRyan.question = \"Why are you are always disrespectful towards me?\";\nRyan.speak( Ryan.question );\n\n/* Chris defines and speaks his answer */\nChris.answer = \"I'm not. You're just not smart enough to know when I'm right.\";\nChris.speak( Chris.answer );\n\n/* Redefine the pronoun to refer to Chris's answer */\npronoun = Chris.answer; \n\n/* Now Ryan defines and speaks his response */\nRyan.response = \"It's\" + pronoun + conjunction + \"I'm talking about.\";\nRyan.speak( Ryan.response );\n```\n\nTo take this comparison even farther, you could find parallels for nouns, adjectives and verbs in the above program.\n\n**Nouns**\n\nEach speaker is \"typed\" as an `Object`. Not as in \"typed on a keyboard\", but as in the speaker's value is of the `Object` type. In English, each speaker would be typed as a _noun_.\n\n**Adjectives**\n\nA word that describes or modifies a _noun_ is considered an _adjective_. Similarly, the properties and methods (referred to as members) of an `Object` can describe and modify that `Object`. Our speakers each have a `role` property to describe the part they play in the conversation.\n\n**Verbs**\n\nA _verb_ describes an action or occurrence and in the beginning of the above program, the function named `speak` does just that. Instead of running `speak` on as a standalone (via `speak()`), I decided to create a `speak` member in each speaker and use the standalone `speak` function as its value. This effectively creates a method (used as `Ryan.speak()`). Now, each speaker can have its own voice.\n\nThe `speak` function takes one argument, `message`, which is the value passed into the parenthesis used to execute the function. The function simply calls `alert`, which creates a little browser notification dialog.\n\nWhile I didn't set out to write a introductory to programming, It's nice to finally write down the way I think about these things. At least I can point to it when my friends want some sort basic understanding of programming, which is never, of course.\n"

Art school has definitely made for some strange bedfellows.\n\nIt was motivating to see where I placed in all of the topics, as my approach to learning programming has been to acquire as much understanding as possible about the the things I don't know. Finding that I was at level 2, but knowing the existence of the concepts in level 3 validates that this approach is moving me in the right direction.\n\nI likened this philosophy to Elizabeth the other day as analogous to how one understands their city. We live in LA, a big, sprawling metropolis, and while I've never been to Monrovia or Cerritos (far out there), I understand that both are cities in Los Angeles County. Not the best example, sure, but one that illustrates the differences in approach. I actively seek out and retain this type of understanding in the belief that it may be useful at some point. Others my see it as the inevitable result of living in the same place a long time.\n\nA better example would be to relate it to one's chosen career. Using this angle, it becomes quickly evident that the ones who take an active approach are usually more successful (the definition of the success is based on the specific domain, of course). Conversely, those taking a passive approach tend to exert more effort in defending how what they _do_ know is more tried and true, and hence more reliable. More dangerously, as a superior, they tend to actively block their peers and subordinates. Anyone who has worked in a university or college setting will loudly attest.\n\n**[Deep Linking with Javascript](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/)**\n\nOpen sourced javascript implementation for linking to paragraphs, and even sentences, in webpages.

And when that time comes, it will definitely be on a [Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) keyboard.\n\nI started the typing tests last year and unfortunately, lasted only a week. It takes the same discipline as QWERTY (no surprise there), but I find the layout much easier to memorize. Now, if Apple could get on the ball with creating a beautifully designed split keyboard, I could get rid of this [clunker](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=043). It's hideous, poorly constructed and loud (key paddings wear out quickly), but it's still the most comfortable I've found.\n"

The more I do it, the more sensitive I become to little things that interrupt the image, dust and hair. I've bought canned air, white gloves, and microfiber rags, but I still can't seem to get a predictable reduction in the amount of these clingy interlopers. In fact, it's gotten worse.\n\nFed up, I started scouring the web looking for similar stories in the hopes that there was a method to this arcane practice I was overlooking. I'm learning that scanning film (using consumer flatbed scanners) is as shifty as the guy on the street trying to sell you a \"genuine\" Rolex. Everyone has \"the best way\" to do it. And it's exactly opposite to the other guy's \"the best way\". The thing is, both guys are getting great results.\n\nSo, noticing that my latest results were showing the same dust pattern regardless of how much I cleaned the glass, I decided to take the scanner apart, thinking the dust was on the underside of the glass. An hour later I do the first scan with no film on the glass (first strip). I'm swearing to myself that this is the same pre-disassembly pattern. I wipe the glass, scan again (strip 2) and find exactly the same result. WTFUCKKKKK?!\n\nSo I start thinking through all the surfaces that have a stake in scanning the film. Both sides of the glass, as well as both sides of the film have been my working assumptions. The only thing left is the light in the lid. But surely, any dust on that would be diffused since it's furthest from the scanner head, and surely outside the head's short depth of field. One quick wipe, another scan (strip 3), son of a bitch... Strip 4 shows that it was pretty much the problem all along.\n\nScanning really sucks. Too many variables to keep track of. But, until I get rich enough to get a lab to do it, or I get sick of film (no chance), I'm stuck with it\n\nI'm almost through my first batch, a September surfing trip. I'll post the best when they're done. The next batch is 2 roles from India. No idea what those have in store. They went through countless x-ray machines and were shot with my Holga (which is even more dangerous to film).\n"

It's just that I hate it when something so functional is wasted because it's too expensive to fix. It's even worse when it's been in service for 51 years. And, when it was supposedly owned by the flutist from WAR (I bought it from the person who bought it from him). I mean, you can't make that kind of history up.\n\nI still have a mind to fix it, a very small mind. The Hasselblad tech thought it pretty impractical, though.

    "url": "/blog/2011/02/03/toggle-class-the-jquery-way-vs-the-native-way",
    "body": "\nI work with a team of developers located in the US, Canada and Bangalore. On behalf of the North American team, I send daily status emails detailing what each dev worked on, as well as their [svn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion 'Apache Subversion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia') commit log, so the offshore devs and project leadership can stay synced.\n\nFor the past 2 or 3 weeks I've been including little quick tips on CSS and javascript. The team I'm on is composed of people with a variable level of skills and this is an attempt to affect those levels.\n\nI thought I'd start posting some of these to archive ones I would have found helpful when I first started programming.\n\nWe use [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ 'jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library') in our project and the majority of the devs (including myself) learned javascript via jQuery. Below is what it takes to toggle a class using jQuery vs. native javascript. As you can see, we've had it easy.\n\n**The jQuery Way**\n\n```js\n$('.some-class').toggleClass('newClass');\n```\n\n**The Native Way** (I'm sure there are better ways):\n\n```js\nvar i = 0,\n    elements = document.getElementsByClassName('some-class'),\n    len = elements.length,\n    classToggle = function( element, tclass ) {\n\n        var classes = elements\\[i\\].className,\n            pattern = new RegExp( tclass );\n            hasClass = pattern.test( classes );\n\n        classes = hasClass ? classes.replace( pattern, '' ) : classes + ' ' + tclass;\n        elements\\[i\\].className = classes.trim();\n    };\n\nfor ( ; i < len; i++ ) {\n    classToggle( elements\\[i\\], 'newClass' );\n}\n```\n\nThe native example could be wrapped up a bit tighter to make it easily reusable. One of the reasons the jQuery example is so concise is that it relies on it's own methods for making collections and performing loops. The `$` and `toggleClass` functions have quite a bit of code backing them up. If I were to add in all of the source code jQuery uses to preform these tasks, things would look a lot different.\n\nBut that's not the point. The thing that has enabled me to use jQuery as just one of the tools in my toolbox, instead of the _only_ tool, is understanding the underlying functionality.\n\nA couple of good references: the [jQuery source](http://bit.ly/jqsource) (of course) and the [MDC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).\n"

Then, a few weeks ago, my Nikon F3 fell off the dining room table and the winder mechanism refused to advance. I also fell with it in my padded shoulder bag while skating across a street. Seriously, what's with the winders?!\n\nI understand the Hasselblad, but the Nikon is a tank. I originally bought it from friend and skateboard photographer [Nick Accurso](http://www.flickr.com/photos/fatnick/ \"Fat Nick The Photographer's Photostream\") in the late 1990's. That thing took a beating with him. But with me, if it falls off a table onto a wooden floor/onto a street in a padded bag and it's done? The advance gear is probably just jammed, but the cost to fix it was the same as the used replacement, and the replacement is in waaay better condition.\n\nSo, here they are, in a really corny shot on my dining room table.\n\n![](images/2011-05-15-at-11-19-07.jpg '2011-05-15-at-11-19-07')\n\nOriginal Nikon is from 1982, the \"new\" one, 1984.

    "body": "\nThe fourth installment of images from my 2 week [trip to Bangalore, India](/blog/tag/first-trip-to-india/). The following were taken Tuesday November 9, 2010 (day 3).\n\nLike I wrote in the [last post](/blog/2011/05/30/the-daily-commute-photos-from-india), the majority of my first week of pictures were from the back of the taxi. Most of my coworkers used them as their standard transportation to and from work. No reason to drive yourself if one of the perks of employment was a paid taxi service.\n\nExcept for the first day, I had the same driver, Srinivas, for the whole the trip. He picked me up at 9am and dropped me at 10:30pm, everyday. Even though his English was pretty much non-existent (like my Kannada), we got pretty good at communicating. We both seemed to enjoy the challenge of trying to find simplistic words or symbols that were loaded enough to stand-in for elemental concepts we both, regardless of culture, understood. He was a really great source for insight into some of the things I was seeing from the backseat.\n\nHe wanted to make sure that before the end my trip I got a picture of him. When the time came, it was 4am and we were at the airport. I was stressed from functioning on 1 hour of sleep and didn't have the energy to dig out my camera and snap one off. I'm sorry I didn't.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-1.jpg)\n\nMy first hotel looked nice at first, but as you see from the mess out front, it wasn't optimal. It was the little things that bugged me, jackhammers at 6:30am, temperature control that didn't get above 58° fahrenheit, and rooms that knocked you down with the smell of mildew (I tried three different rooms). Look closely, my room is the one with the shades fully open. An insomniatic eye with a front row seat to the action.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-2.jpg)\n\nAnother interestingly long name, \"National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Insects\". Muted yellows were the popular color for government buildings. In LA, it's gray cement. \\[**Update**\\] [Gopi](http://www.getsetgopi.com/ 'Gopinath Prasanna - Creativity | Thoughts | Imagination') emailed that the yellow is in reference to the the holy colors of yellow and red, respectively meaning peace and courage\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-3.jpg)\n\nTwin homes that got the twin treatment (with surgical accuracy, no less) when, what looks to be, a road widening was needed. They probably didn't need that pesky extra room anyway.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-4.jpg)\n\nAll commercial trucks were ornately painted. I would have loved to get more up-close shots of the work. From what I was told, they were only allowed on the road at night, if hauling, due to congestion and pollution. Trucks were usually lined up along the side of the road during the day. Another feature every truck displayed, the \"Sound Horn\" directive. As if Indian drivers need to be told to honk a horn. You'd think they were getting horn-honking royalties they way they laid on it. Srinivas was amazed that it was the opposite, and even seen as rude, in America. My little brain was fried from all the horns when I arrived to work every morning. Some even had a sped up UK-style police siren, de-da-le-da-le-da-leeeeeeeeeeee!\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-5.jpg)\n\nConstruction on the flyover created heavy traffic where people, and cars, were put in precarious situations. At one point we came within inches of knocking a motorcyclist off the road while going 30-40 mph. I squelched loudly, only to have Srinivas laugh and tell me that \"3 centimeters\" was considered close. And he was right, the motorcyclist just looked at us nonchalantly as if he didn't even notice his near-death.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-6.jpg)\n\nNotice the rebar at the back-left corner of the building. Many on the buildings we passed were started, but never finished.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-7.jpg)\n\nMorning drive-by of a quickie stand. Always bananas-a-plenty.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-8.jpg)\n\nWaiting to have our car checked for bombs on the way into the business park. They'd stare at us for a bit, roll a big mirror under the front and back of the car, and open the trunk. Same thing at night when entering the hotel driveway.\n\n![](images/india-nov-9-9.jpg)\n\nView from the cafeteria balcony. There was construction everywhere, except for this lot.\n"

The following were taken Monday November 8, 2010 (day 2).\n\nWhy has it taken so long for me to post them, you ask? I guess I just needed time to process things. It was a really hectic business trip that required me to work pretty much non-stop. It's taken a while to filter out some of my personal thoughts. Plus, only recently have responsibilities at work started to slow down to where I can act on projects that require some level of creativity. Stay tuned as I have more to come. ![](images/india-nov-8-2.jpg)\n\nThis was the scene at both hotels in which I stayed during my trip. No matter what, entry to the lobby required a trip through the ole' metal detector. The guards were always courteous, unlike the average trip to your gate at the any US airport.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-3.jpg)\n\nA view from my taxi on the way to work. Unfortunately, my first week of pictures were mostly from the back of the taxi. Pictured here, two words I saw often: \"[Vijay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay)\", meaning _victory_ and incorporated, in some form or another, into many of the names of guys I met during my stay, and the brand name \"[Kingfisher](http://www.kingfisherworld.com/)\", specializing in everything from beer to airlines.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-4.jpg)\n\nAn \"Auto\" (short for \"Auto Rickshaw\"). Some of the guys tried to persuade me into one of these little doozies, but I refused on the grounds that I was often scared shitless just riding in regular taxis. Not sure what advantage the covering on the side was providing.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-5.jpg)\n\nAnother 3-wheeler. Something tells me that lone little wheel up front isn't going to help much in a tight turn, which is often needed to avoid some of the \"creative\" techniques drivers often use to get through traffic.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-6.jpg)\n\n\"Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals\". I saw a lot of these types of buildings. Very socialist looking architecture with long, socialist sounding names.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-7.jpg)\n\nI was amazed that instead of graffiti, many walls hand unblemished murals. I later asked one of my colleagues, Gopinath Prasanna (Gopi) about their significance. He explained that there is a trend followed in India that whenever a new movie is released, posters of the movie are pasted on walls around the city (\"any damn wall\", as he put it). To avoid this, the BMP ([Bangalore Mahanagara Palike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruhat_Bengaluru_Mahanagara_Palike), a Bangalore Civic Organization) started collecting money from the film producers, mistakenly assuming it would dissuade them off the practice. Finally, the BMP had the idea of painting the walls instead. The paintings range from the history of [Karnataka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka) to the imagination of local artists.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-8.jpg)\n\nA highway exit sign. I was really drawn to fatter variants of the [Kannada script](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_script). Especially when hand-painted. (Kannada is the official language of the state of Karnataka, of which, Bangalore is the capital).\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-9.jpg)\n\nThe \"floating boating\" label always made me laugh. It makes for a nice addition to \"[bouncy house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflatable#Inflatables_for_entertainment 'Inflatable - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia')\" in the collection of goofy names for fun activities. On the other side of this was was a big public lake that looked closed for the season.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-10.jpg)\n\nMorning commuters getting some breakfast on their way to work.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-11.jpg)\n\nAnother morning spot for a quick bite on the way to, or from work. Not so appetizing to my eye. From what Gopi told me, these sorts of places are the equivalent of a really rough, greasy-spoon-style diner. Vodafone or Sprite always seemed to be the big advertiser.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-12.jpg)\n\nGopi (left) and Tarence Naveen Dsouza, two of my helpful and courteous colleagues. This was at a little café near the office where I tried to get some American-style coffee. No luck though. The predominant coffee I found was very watered down, but with a super harsh taste. Everyone I saw drinking it used a boatload of cream. I drink my coffee black (insert joke from [Airplane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hlb2PtB6JGo) here), which meant I stuck with tea for most of the trip.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-13.jpg)\n\nMy attempts to use my camera's flash weren't all that great. With this one, I think I was trying to capture the big trough on the side of the road, a storm gutter that would have swallowed any motorcyclist who wasn't careful.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-14.jpg)\n\nEvery evening on the way back to the hotel was a big, 6 or 7 street intersection. The only traffic control was a dude holding a piece of rope across the street as a barrier. We usually sat here for around 15 minutes. After about the first minute or two, everyone would simply turn off their lights and engines.\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-15.jpg)\n\nOnce we were past the big intersection, the race was on! The intersection was under major construction for something called a \"flyover\".\n\n![](images/india-nov-8-16.jpg)\n\nAfter wondering what the hell a \"flyover\" was, a quick search online defined it as an \"overpass\". Pretty obvious, but I kept telling myself it had something to do with airplanes as the word \"fly\" kept jamming my logic.\n"

    "body": "\nThe fifth installment of images from my 2 week [trip to Bangalore, India](/blog/tag/first-trip-to-india/). The following were taken Wednesday November 10, 2010 (day 4).\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-1.jpg)\n\nLike in the US, drinking Coke makes people pretty! It was interesting to see how advertising trends differed from America. I saw many like this, light-skinned, shinny-happy people with collars usually popped, and often jumping into the frame. The compositions were always busy, packed with text and color. It felt odd as these models really didn't represent the majority of people I saw. I figure it's the same for foreigners in the US. Americans are bombarded with the equivalent, but maybe we've lived with advertising longer and as a result, the models ([mostly](http://www.psdisasters.com/2011/05/victorias-secret-elastigirl.html \"PSD: Photoshop Disasters: Victoria's Secret: Elastigirl\")) seem normal. And ferrr sure, when I look around, Americans _definitely_ don't look the part.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-2.jpg)\n\nMorning commuters waiting for the next bus to arrive. Traffic is tight and since cars can quickly swoop in and out to jockey for position and from what I was told, the least agile of the vehicles, buses, make up for it by having some sort of legal immunity when it comes to fender-benders. It makes sense as long they don't rogue. I'm sure LA buses would go hog-wild with power like that.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-3.jpg)\n\nPedestrian making his way to the bus stop. The reason I found this shot interesting was the security feature on the wall behind him. Look closely and you'll see the broken glass cemented to the top to further deter whatever the barbed wire doesn't.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-4.jpg)\n\nI passed this place everyday, but I never asked if Srinivas knew what it was. My assumption was a home. In the mornings I would usually see a women, sometimes with a child in sling, going about standard chores. A few times there was a man doing the same. What didn't make sense though, apart from the obvious, was that these homes (there was another just out of the left frame) were isolated on the frontage road of a busy highway. There was nothing else around them. My first thought, from the bottles in the trees, that it was a recycling station. Each day I passed, it looked more and more like a home. Notice the \"THIS PROPERTY BELONGS\" message on the back wall. Maybe they often get mistaken as squatters. But why is it in English?\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-5.jpg)\n\nDetail of the hand-painted artwork that decorates commercial trucks. They need to be careful, that beach scene is a gateway drug to more [expressive variations](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buglugs/8578997/).\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-6.jpg)\n\nFrom [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkateswara), Balaji is another name for Venkateswara, the sin destroying form of [Vishnu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu). Along with the sharp glass adhered to the sign, these trucks make for an interesting metaphor.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-7.jpg)\n\nEvery time I saw a women riding sidesaddle, the fear I felt during the one (and only) time I rode on the back of a motorcycle came rushing back with a vengeance. I couldn't help imagining what it must have been like (in pants, of course), thus spawning that special little tingle in the nethers that happens when I'm looking down front a really high ledge.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-8.jpg)\n\nThe iridescence of her sari is set off by the drabness and functionality of the motorcycles and cement.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-9.jpg)\n\nThat natural lemon flavor could use a hose-down.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-10.jpg)\n\nSo as not to displease, Balarama waits for the shopkeeper's distraction so he can secretly take care of the sample accepted out politeness.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-11.jpg)\n\nFriends having breakfast together. My driver, Srinivas, wore the same white outfit, which makes me think this is a group of taxi drivers.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-12.jpg)\n\nWhile efficient, these brooms looked like real back-brakers. At least [for my back](/blog/2008/05/15/what-a-herniated-disc-looks-like) anyway.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-13.jpg)\n\nThis little girl was too cute. I was just sitting in traffic watching her try to use that big broom to get up. It took her a few tries.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-14.jpg)\n\nNot sure if this was a makeshift bus stop or these guys were waiting on their carpool.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-15.jpg)\n\nNitin, thinking he was on the right path, is confused to hear that his \"Helping Hands\" design is not specific enough to properly evoke the \"extreme ambiguity\" of the _Gilgal Solutions_ brand.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-16.jpg)\n\nPadmaraj, one of my colleagues. I didn't get to spend much time with him due to his contracting [dengue fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever) 4 days into my visit. The updates we were given during his stay in the hospital sounded horrific. With a nickname like \"breakbone fever\", you can easily get a good idea of what he went through.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-17.jpg)\n\nThe team wearing traditional [kurtas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta) for \"Ethnic Day\". I got one as well and wore it the whole day. They're pretty comfortable. From left to right: Vijay, Padmaraj, Senthil S., Renjith, Jeyaraj, Gopi, Dipta, Elayaraja, Senthil V., Pradeep.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-18.jpg)\n\nOn on my way to lunch, I appreciated the elevator's honesty.\n\n![](images/india-nov-10-19.jpg)\n\nMy standard lunch for the first week. While cafeteria food in the US is known to be pretty bad, this stuff was really tasty. Only experiencing Indian food in the US, I expected to be blown away when I got to India. The truth is, it tasted pretty much the same. What I didn't expect though, was to be totally overwhelmed after the first week. My weak little taste buds, lazy from all of the bland grilled cheese, egg sandwiches and bean & cheese burritos, were not strong enough to weather, for every meal, the extremely rich Indian spices. So, unfortunately, my second week had to consist of veggie burgers with french fries, Domino's Pizza (which tasted exactly the same) and really bad fettucini alfredo.\n"

    "body": "\nThe sixth installment of images from my 2 week [trip to Bangalore, India](/blog/tag/first-trip-to-india/). The following were taken Friday, November 12, 2010 (day 6). (_My D90 was still set to PST so the EXIF date is a bit behind._)\n\nSince I had yet to visit my company's Bangalore office, Gopi and I decided to take Friday to do just that. It was a whole day trip as the two offices were on either sides of the city. Even though it was a mere 12 miles, I remember the trip taking roughly 1.5-2 hours.\n\nAfterwards, we went to a local mall to see if there were any deals to be had. I'd been told that goods were significantly cheaper than what I was used to in the US. This may true in the right place, but this mall was not one of those places, at least for men's clothing. The other factor was that my sleeve length and waist size were simply not stocked. The last men's store I walked into, the salesman, without a word, immediately measured my sleeve and waist, looked up at me with a regretful smile and slowly did the head bobble. From that point I decided that focusing on shopping for Elizabeth would be more successful.\n\nSince Gopi was roughly Elizabeth's same height, he generously volunteered to hold up potential purchases so I could determine the fit. Not a scene you'd easily find with a couple of straight dudes in America, but, as I'm sure Elizabeth will corroborate, it worked out great. I ended up buying a few nice [kurtas](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&biw=1916&bih=1083&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=women+short+kurta&oq=women+short+kurta&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=7975l9190l0l9942l6l6l0l0l0l4l238l1173l0.3.3l6 'Google') and a sari as the prices for women's clothes were definitely cheaper.\n\nSo on with the pics, 24 in total and mostly from the road.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-1.jpg)\n\nI know I keep posting shots of these commercial trucks, but it's details like the top of the passenger window and the sprite where the bed of the truck meets the cab that I find so interesting. I think this one is the last.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-2.jpg)\n\nAfter touring the [Bangalore office](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=214083101619803878965.0004a8496624cfb1fd362&msa=0&ll=12.985584,77.743421&spn=0.010256,0.016469), we passed this fruit vendor while walking to a nearby restaurant. I was fully saturated with Indian food at this point and was hoping the restaurant had something vaguely American (bland). I remember it distinctly because he was at the intersection of an alley and Whitefield road (the main thoroughfare). As I stepped into the alleyway, which was more like a wind tunnel, I was overwhelmed with the stench of raw sewage. It truly almost knocked me on my ass. No one else seemed to notice the smell. The restaurant was directly across the alley and needless to say, nothing on the menu sounded appetizing. On a side note, notice the \"Gents\" posting? These were all over. They're notices of rooms for let. Even though I knew better, I kept thinking they were something totally different (this ad was a lot more specific than most). Gopi eventually set me straight.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-3.jpg)\n\nYou'll find [tender coconuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut#Seed 'Coconut - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia') everywhere. The tops are lopped off and sold with a straw. Nature's juice box.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-4.jpg)\n\nWhitefield road had lots of vendors. This one supplied the cigarettes. When I got a little closer, I didn't recognized any of the brands. Not only that, the graphic design on the packaging had the feel of the 1950's or 60's. This was a trend I saw often, even major brands were still using early versions of their product's branding.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-5.jpg)\n\nGopi posing for a demonstration on \"depth of field\". This is also where we ended up eating, a little outdoor coffee place within the business park where my company's office was located. I had a plain, microwaved veggie burger with cheese. Meh.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-6.jpg)\n\nThe sun was going down and the light was starting to get golden. We were at this intersection for about 10-15 minutes, so I snapped a few pedestrians. This women stood out as I saw very few women wearing business suits.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-7.jpg)\n\nYou're not going to find one of these old Fila bags in the US these days.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-8.jpg)\n\nA Gentleman taking a quick snooze. I felt the same way at this point. It didn't help that we'd been sitting at this intersection for so long. In general, I feel time spent at intersections has a similarity with the math used to calculate dog years.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-9.jpg)\n\nI found this to be an interesting arrangement of shape and color.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-10.jpg)\n\nAs you'll see in the next installment, wild dogs were everywhere.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-11.jpg)\n\nA vendor pushing her cart the opposite direction of traffic. I saw a similar cart being pushed down the slow lane of a majorly packed highway. It was pretty standard.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-12.jpg)\n\nA moldy water tower. The thought of climbing up that ladder gives me the tinglies.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-13.jpg)\n\nSandbags waiting in line for a piece of the action.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-14.jpg)\n\nOne of the many impromptu food vendors. Gopi pointed out that [panipuri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panipuri) was the food being sold.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-15.jpg)\n\nNot sure I could've shot this picture if it wasn't from a passing car. Their looks of suspicion are exactly what I find hard to ignore when shooting candid pictures of people.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-16.jpg)\n\nWith the sun close to setting, this image of a man adjusting his bike seat is one of my favorites.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-17.jpg)\n\nBoy texting (I think) while selling tender coconuts. These are much larger and require a machete (top of the pile) to slice open. Nothing about that blade looks sanitary enough to come into contact with food.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-18.jpg)\n\nWomen stringing up what looks to be flower garlands ([Gajra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajra)). Notice that the man sitting to her right is caked in a pink color. Not sure what's going on there. [Gopi has identified](#comment-29233) that the man is suffering from [leukoderma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukoderma). The color is actually a lack of pigmentation. I've seen similar afflictions, but never as broad as this man's leg.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-19.jpg)\n\nWhoops. I lied. One more truck. But this one is just because I liked the hand painted branding.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-20.jpg)\n\nApparently, steel poles are not the standard when constructing scaffolding. More tinglies...\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-21.jpg)\n\nA hand-painted license plate. I also saw hand-painted declarations on the sides of commercial vehicles such as license to haul in the state of Karnataka in general. I wonder if these are enforced, anyone could paint these on their vehicles as there didn't seem to be any specific, hard-to-reproduce aspect of the application.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-22.jpg)\n\nThe sun's angle highlighting the large amount of pollution. We were almost to the mall and I was getting sleepy.\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-23.jpg)\n\nSo was this guy. (Remember, the steering wheel is on the other side of the car)\n\n![](images/india-nov-12-24.jpg)\n\nThe sari store. This was a unique experience. The process of buying a sari involves sitting at one of the tables and explaining to the salesperson what your looking for. They then proceed to pull down a bunch to choose from. Those choices are then modeled by one of the female employees. I had no understanding of the difference between a wedding sari and an average everyday sari. They were all simply bright and decorative fabrics to my eye. I ended up with a mustard yellow and maroon sari. It's way too big for Elizabeth but a friend has offered to do the fitting when E's ready to wear it.\n"

    "title": "To Be, or Not to Be, an Anchor",
    "url": "/blog/2011/08/24/to-be-or-not-to-be-an-anchor",
    "body": "\nIn reading [Chris Coyier's response](http://css-tricks.com/13780-when-and-when-not-to-use-an-anchor-tag/ \"When (and when not to) use an anchor tag? | CSS-Tricks\") to a reader's question on when to choose an anchor element over some other element when creating javascript-driven experiences, I realized that only recently did I form a concrete opinion on the matter. My response originally started as a comment on Coyier's post, but quickly turned into a full post of its own.\n\nHere's the part of Chris's response with which I identified most:\n\n> If the app is totally JavaScript dependent all behavior is attached via JavaScript, I guess it doesn't really matter what element you use.\n\nUntil recently, I would have given the same answer. For the past year and a half I've been part of a large team working on the rewrite of a major ecommerce site that required full accessibility for blind, low-vision and cognitively disabled users. Being a javascript-heavy UI, it required a lot more effort in discerning the semantics of an HTML element.\n\nI plan on writing a lot more about that experience, but right now I want to respond specifically to the question of when to use an anchor element.\n\nThe reader says that he generally used the `a` tag liberally to represent an element as clickable.\n\nIn brief, that's the safest choice. But the natural inclination of a developer (ideally) is to dig as deep as possible and make the most informed choice. After all, their the ones who have to support it when things get wonky.\n\nIf you decide on something other than an anchor though, just make sure the element you choose is accessible to keyboards and screen readers. Easy. Done.\n\nOf course, it can be a lot more complicated than that. Anchor elements are natively focusable and screen readers provide functionality for navigating a page by its anchors. This allows to users to quickly scan the page via their keyboard. Visual users often (and understandably) take for granted their ability to visually scan a page since it's a natural response and not specific to viewing a webpage. But, substituting a different element can require a lot more effort in facilitating a equal experience to non-visual users.\n\nUsing `tabindex` with a value of `0` on a non-natively focusable element will allow for the element to be navigated via the tab key, and in the order of the natural document flow. But the catch is that a screen reader will not include the element in its anchor shortcut feature. This may not be necessary if the the element's purpose would not make sense outside of its surrounding context, like a tooltip, for example.\n\nMore importantly though, the screen reader will not speak the element as a _link_. Visual users employ visual clues to interpret actionable elements in a page. Screen readers rely on semantics. While a visual user can instantly recognize a button by its design, a screen reader can do so only if a `button` element is used.\n\nAlso, it's good to understand that `title` attributes are not necessarily spoken when a screen reader user is focused on an element that contains one. The popular screen reader [JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/fs/jaws-product-page.asp \"JAWS Screen Reading Software by Freedom Scientific\") provides this as an op-in preference. So using a `span` as an actionable element will need both a `title` attribute _and_ screen-reader-only text (off-screen) to communicate to the user the purpose of the element.\n\nUltimately, an anchor element provides users an actionable element that's accepted as a means to navigate information. Regardless of whether the navigation happens via a full page refresh, asynchronously, or with javascript turned off, the underlying meaning remains the same. Using it liberally is a good choice.\n\n**Update: 8.24.2011**\n\nRegarding ARIA, support is getting better, but it's still pretty spotty. In fact, I’ve had to remove ARIA attributes at times because of screen reader conflicts. It can also change how the user's screen reader interacts with a page (Form and Application modes). This can be disorienting to a user who has yet to master the full feature set of their screen reader. But after reading Dave's comment below, I figured I should give the `link` role a try. I use the `role` when it's useful, but the `link` value is one I've never considered.\n\nI used the following markup for my quick test:\n\n```html\n<span id=\"link\" role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\">Test Link</span>\n```\n\nSurprisingly, JAWS 12 with IE8 spoke the element as a _link_. I was also able to navigate to it using the `u` key shortcut (navigates unvisited links). The `v` key did not register it as a visited link even though it had been clicked. That makes sense since there's no `href`. Good to know.\n\n**Update: 11.8.2011**\n\nI’ve put up a [page of various attempts to mimic links](http://ryanfitzer.github.com/Demos/mimic-links/). Not exhaustive, but should be helpful in drawing general conclusions. I’ll add to it as I get more examples and time.\n"

    "url": "/blog/2011/09/01/hyphen-camelcase-or-underscore",
    "body": "\nMy choice of word combination patterns depends on the language. I initially tried to use a one-size-fits-all approach, but as my projects became more complex with multiple languages, it got really annoying when the pattern did not match the language. The old standby argument of \"readability\" quickly loses its validity when you're dealing with code. For instance, PHP can contain javascript, html and css and uses underscores for functions. Depending on your text editor syntax hi-lighting, a javascript function (camelCase) could use the same coloring as a PHP function (underscore). Since you can't depend on color alone, using each language's pattern enables you to immediately know the difference.\n\nThere will always be edge cases (PHP uses `CamelCase` for classes), but I find that sticking with each language's word combination patterns make for the least friction possible.\n\nWith that said, here are my current choices:\n\n**PHP** Variable: `underscore` Function: `underscore` Class: `CamelCase`\n\n**Javascript** Variable: `camelCase` Function: `camelCase` Constructor: `CamelCase`\n\n**CSS** Class: `hyphen` ID: `hyphen`\n\n**HTML** Custom Attributes: `hyphen`\n\nWith html, the `data-` prefix is one defense, even though attributes like `tabindex` differ. Also, an underscore is technically meant to augment a letter or word, while a hyphen is used to separate words or syllables.\n\nRegular Expression engines use the same characterizations.\n\nFor example, using the text:\n\n```\nsome-word some\\_word\n```\n\nwith the regex matching pattern:\n\n```\n\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b\n```\n\nthe resulting array of matches is:\n\n```\n\\[0\\] => some\n\\[1\\] => word\n\\[2\\] => some\\_word\n```\n\nThis may seem like I'm over-thinking things, but like I said, I want the least amount of friction when I work.\n"

    "body": "\n![Flipping the print](images/2011-11-15-at-15-21-27.jpg)\n\nFlipping the print over so it could be rolled up and placed in a tube for the trip to the framer.\n\nI'm in the process of getting negatives drum scanned for a new body of work that will be comprised of a series of large-scale (at least 48\"x48\") [composited images](/blog/2010/08/29/photo-compositing). This will be the first time I've used photography and Photoshop in my work, which has primarily been sculpture.\n\nI've been making photographs as a hobbyist for a long time, but until recently, Photoshop was mostly an application I used for minimal photo editing and turning designs into web pages. Tools like layer masks, layer adjustments, blending modes, brushes, and most of the other 8 million options were of no use to me. Now that my needs have changed, I've been going through a crash course on workflows and tools needed in photo compositing. This also involves getting used to a tablet, which is necessary (and so much easier) in this type of work.\n\nThe best technical information I've found has come from a video series named [\"Calvinize: Signature Techniques of Photoshop Artist Calvin Hollywood\"](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780132732550 'Calvinize: Signature Techniques of Photoshop Artist Calvin Hollywood: Safari Books Online') (he also has some short [tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/user/Calvinhollywood#p/u/199/Z8V_M5sJntM \"Calvinhollywood's Channel - YouTube\") on youtube). It's mostly concerned with beauty retouching, but the technical information definitely applies to my project. Plus, with a great German accent, lively narration and a lot of skill, Mr. Calvin easily beats out the drones in the other series I've tried.\n\nSince I have no experience with large-scale printing, I wanted to go through the process before printing anything from the series. I decided the perfect candidate was a photo of [Sunset Beach on a glooming morning](/blog/2011/10/16/a-long-break), one I've wanted to print since the first time I saw the proof sheet. If you've clicked on the image, you'll immediately notice the terrible reproduction I was able to eek out of my flatbed scanner. While the scanner is on the low-end (Canoscan 8800F), it's usually pretty good with most images, at least for the web. It turns out that the negative had some issues. After drum scanning it, the nice folks at [The Icon](http://www.iconla.com/) told me it may have been mishandled at some point, either while loading the camera or unloading the finished roll. Makes sense, I was still getting used to loading a Hasselblad when I used it to shoot the photo a year ago. Luckily their scan was nowhere near as screwed as mine and they were skillfully able to work out the issues.\n\nSo yesterday, after a few interesting and informative proofing visits earlier in the process, I picked up the print and dropped it off at the framer. It was definitely more stressful than I'd have guessed. Transporting anything I've spent so much time and money on is always stressful (including cats). And my imagination made sure I'd think about all the mishaps possible in a short drive across LA. Elizabeth helped to keep things in check, though.\n\nThe print looks great and I can't wait to get it back from the framer and on the wall (3 weeks, as they're crazy busy). More importantly, I now understand the process, as well as what to expect in the final output, something I've needed in order to feel comfortable enough to keep moving forward.\n"

    "url": "/blog/2011/11/30/easy-syncing-of-github-pages",
    "body": "\nI’ve started using [GitHub](http://github.com) more and more recently as I’m finding Git’s steep learning curve, as compared to SVN, outweighed by GitHub’s usefulness and flexibility. One of those factors is GitHub’s “[Pages](http://pages.github.com/)” feature. From the docs:\n\n> The GitHub Pages feature allows you to publish content to the web by simply pushing content to one of your GitHub hosted repositories.\n\nFor example, I’ve recently started a repo to begin adding the many miscellaneous tests, POCs and demos I create during the course of development. Instead of requiring someone to download the repo just to see the examples, I use GitHub Pages to host the rendered version (when applicable). The “[Mimicking Links](http://ryanfitzer.github.com/Demos/mimic-links/)” page is the first one I’ve published.\n\nGitHub makes this automatic when you create a branch of your `master` named `gh-pages`. Any time you push to `gh-pages`, the results are published. Easy enough, but I quickly realized that I needed a way to mirror all changes on `master` in `gh-pages` without constantly having to type:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout gh-pages\ngit merge master\ngit push origin gh-pages\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nSome quick searching turned up Oli Studholme’s helpful post “[GitHub Pages and deleting git’s master branch](http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/)”. He outlines his own attempts (and suggestions from the comments) and what finally worked for him. Since he had more requirements (deleting the `master` branch), I wanted to post exactly what I’ve ended on.\n\nFirst, create your local repo and add it to GitHub.\n\nFrom the command line, navigate into the root of your repo and run following block of code as referenced in the “[Project Pages](http://pages.github.com/#project_pages)” section of the GitHub Pages docs (make sure you have no changes waiting to be committed):\n\ngit symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages\nrm .git/index\ngit clean -fdx\n\nNow that your working directory is clean, merge in the `master` branch and push `gh-pages` to GitHub:\n\ngit merge master\ngit push origin gh-pages\n\nYou can now visit the url `http:username.github.com/yourRepo/` to view the results (the first push may take a little time to show your changes).\n\nNow that your pages are in place, you’ll want to automate the merging[\\[1\\]](#fn:1 'see footnote') to `gh-pages` any changes you commit in `master`.\n\nTo do this, open the `post-commit.sample` file located in `yourRepo/.git/hooks` and replace its contents with the following, saving it as `post-commit`:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/sh\n# Mirror master in gh-pages\ngit checkout gh-pages\ngit merge master\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nThis block will run after every commit you make to the `master` branch (you’ll see the output on the command line).\n\nAll that’s left to do is push both branches to GitHub any time you've made a commit:\n\n```shell\ngit push --all\n```\n\nI’m still pretty new to Git/GitHub, so any suggestions or corrections are appreciated.\n\n---\n\n2. Oli’s post suggests `rebase`, but I’m sticking with `merge` as I understand it better.  [↩](#fnref:1 'return to article')\n"

    "body": "\n \n\n![](images/sketch_11.jpg)\n\nI made these a couple of years ago and they've kept their spot on my studio wall through many sessions where I've pulled down things that either I've already absorbed or have lost my attention.\n\nThe first one (black mass) has evolved over time. The fact that I can still make out the original object behind the black is what keeps intriguing me. The second sketch was simply a test for different gel mediums.\n\n![](images/sketch_21.jpg)\n\nThe lack of registration between the yellow, blue and line drawing is what makes this one unresolved. Each layer on the paper reads pretty distinctly on their own. But they create an implied total object when taken as whole. That they're not trying very hard to interact, but still affect the whole more than I would have expected is what is so surprising to me. This goes for the black sketch as well.\n\nThis is where I'm at right now, trying to build objects from disparate parts that still have some interesting attributes when taken individually.\n\nI plan on updating my portfolio with the work I've made in the past few years. I've shot most of it, just in the middle of moving this site to a new platform (WordPress -> [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)). I'm halfway there.\n"
